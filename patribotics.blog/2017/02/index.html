<p>When the Steele dossier was published by Buzzfeed, with an entirely appropriate amount of caveats, other journalistic outlets rushed to pour cold water on it, and wrongly so.</p>
<p>Chief among these was CNN. Acting as if Buzzfeed had <em>not </em>offered caveats alongside the publication, CNN blasted the news site as though they had irresponsibly published &#8216;fake news&#8217;.</p>
<p>In fact, the credibility of Chris Steele was sky-high in the intelligence community, and the heads of all three agencies had included his dossier as an addendum to the Russian hacking report they produced for the President (Obama, at the time; but Trump was also given a version of it).</p>
<p>One bit of journalistic malfeasance committed by CNN was that they rubbished the dossier&#8217;s claims on Michael Cohen without doing independent journalistic research of their own.</p>
<p>Inanely, CNN claimed that they had it &#8220;confirmed&#8221; that Michael Cohen was not in Prague, Czech Republic, when the dossier said he was.</p>
<p>They based this on the fact that, as they claimed, &#8220;a different Michael Cohen&#8221; had been in Prague around that time, according to a passport stamp. This has nothing to do with the matter one way or the other, and a little thought by CNN would have borne that out. The dossier alleged that Cohen went to Prague and another EU country; that was rated as low confidence as to both location and to exact timing. August, at one point; late August or early September at another point. Furthermore, Steele did not, contrary to CNN&#8217;s implication, present location or timing as a fact. It was secondhand; he reported as fact that Kremlin insiders said this, and Steele rated the exact location and timing as low confidence.</p>
<p>More interesting was the substance of Steele&#8217;s allegations as to why &#8211; he reported sources said &#8211; Cohen was meeting Russians outside of the US. Firstly, it was to pay off hackers. The dossier made the claim that these were both the hackers who had attacked Clinton, and a company that ran a Twitter botnet (possibly also a Facebook one as I shall later report).</p>
<p>I took as my starting point the idea that the Steele dossier should be believed and would be for the most part correct; and that it was more likely to be right than wrong. The reason I took this attitude is that all three heads of US intelligence agencies had included Steele&#8217;s dossier as an adjunct to their report to the President.</p>
<p>That is utterly extraordinary and represents a massive vote of confidence in Steele&#8217;s work. The heads of the FBI, CIA and NSA are not in the habit of including tabloid sensationalism in their official reports, whether as an adjunct or anything else. I do not wish to waste too much time on this, as the report was self-evidently believed to be credible; but contrary to lazy reporting by CNN and others, the dossier was not rubbished by the same agency heads who included it. They said they had not verified the whole of it. That is all. And, again, since parts of the work were not independently verified, its inclusion by the IC represented a colossal vote of confidence in the credibility of Chris Steele (if you are reading this sir please get in touch with me.

<p>Very well then. I posted on Twitter that &#8216;unverified&#8217; and &#8216;unverifiable&#8217; are not synonymous and I started looking for ways to verify the dossier. The first clue was that Cohen did not deny it. Rather, he gave fatuous and whataboutery excuses. To Rosie Gray of the Atlantic, Mr. Cohen stated that he had gone to Los Angeles from the 23rd August onwards. <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelCohen212/status/821099776976494592">He then tweeted:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Feeling like a <a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/RadarOnlineCom"><s>@</s><b>RadarOnlineCom</b></a> celebrity debunking the Russia connection&#8230;all thanks to my <strong>daughter&#8217;s</strong> Instagram</p></blockquote>
<p>Radar Online is owned by Pecker, of &#8216;Trump loves Pecker&#8217; fame. <a href="http://radaronline.com/videos/donald-trump-russia-dossier-scandal-michael-cohen-apology/">The piece tweeted by Cohen</a>, who presumably handed Radar their lines, stated that there was &#8220;proof&#8221; that Cohen never left the USA in August based on metadata from his Twitter account:</p>
<blockquote><p>Metadata from Cohen’s account confirms that he never posted from outside the United States in the entire month of August.</p></blockquote>
<p>The piece also contains video of Cohen on the Sean Hannity show, which is instructional. Cohen says he has never been to Prague and &#8216;proved&#8217; it to Mr. Trump by showing Mr. Trump his passport. Cohen also points Hannity to the &#8216;other Michael Cohen&#8217; jumped on by CNN as &#8216;proof&#8217; that Steele had got it wrong.</p>
<h3>Breaking Down Cohen&#8217;s Statements and Inferring Why He Made Them</h3>
<p>Cohen therefore wanted us to believe that:</p>
<p>a) his social media accounts could prove his whereabouts</p>
<p>b) the second Michael Cohen being in Prague meant that he himself could not also have been in Prague</p>
<p>c) The lack of a stamp in his passport proves he could not have left the country.</p>
<p>Taking as my starting point that Chris Steele is likely correct, I would treat all of the above as likely true on the face of it, but actually false in implied meaning; so that let us assume yes, a different Michael Cohen was in Prague; let us assume that Michael Cohen&#8217;s current passport has no stamp for Prague or out of the country at all in the month of August and September; and that his social media accounts do not have any nice easy &#8216;Sent from Prague&#8217; or &#8216;sent from Moscow&#8217; geotagging on them.</p>
<p>None of that would, however, disprove the allegations in the Steele dossier, which is the implication behind making those assertions.</p>
<p>It is disappointing that American media would treat the one as proving the other. CNN spoke with reverence of a &#8216;second Michael Cohen&#8217; as if that somehow meant the first one could not have left the United States. A Twitter account I now believe to be a peddler of disinformation tried to feed out the line that Cohen had an Israeli passport with a single day&#8217;s difference, explained by the time difference, and that he used this. Now, it is certainly possible that there is only one Michael Cohen who was in Prague on an Israeli passport rather than an American one. But &#8216;Michael Cohen&#8217; is a common enough name. And the dossier alleged that Cohen was meeting Russian intelligence in order to arrange payment for hackers of the election.</p>
<p>It is a fact, indeed, that a Russian hacker, Yvgeny Nikulin, came to Prague to be paid on October 5th and was picked up there by Cezch intelligence on a red warrant from the FBI.</p>
<p>How likely is it that a lawyer representing Donald Trump and meeting with Russian intelligence, to pay off hackers that had attacked the US election on behalf of Russia, would have <em>any </em>stamps in his passport of <em>any </em>country? He would be trying for secrecy, and even if Mr. Cohen is a risible fool, as he is, <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelCohen212/status/818991277685567489">adamantly denying he had ever been to Prague</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have never been to Prague in my life. #fakenews</p></blockquote>
<p>and then telling the Wall Street Journal that he <em>had</em> been to Prague in 2001; even if, as I say, Mr. Cohen was a bombastic fool, Russian intelligence were not fools, and they would, presumably, take good care to get Mr. Cohen into and out of the United States without any stamp in any passport he might legitimately own; and with no record of exit or entry into the United States.</p>
<h2>Mr. Cohen&#8217;s Story Is Provably Untrue</h2>
<p>Cohen&#8217;s story unraveled immediately, in so far as he contradicted himself to the Wall Street Journal about &#8216;ever&#8217; going to Prague. But perhaps he forgot, even though Prague is a very lovely city. Being generous, Mr. Cohen is a well-traveled man, who might indeed have forgotten a trip some 15 years ago. However, he made other, stupid slip-ups. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/michael-cohen-it-is-fake-news-meant-to-malign-mr-trump/512762/">He told Rosie Gray at the Atlantic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cohen said that he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August, and that the rest of the month he was in New York.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Cohen&#8217;s own timeline includes a tweet that shows that <a href="https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/828820913214742530">on the 24th August</a> he was at Newark airport.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly asked Rosie Gray why she has not amended her story to note Cohen&#8217;s statement to her is false, but she has not yet responded.</p>
<p>Why would Cohen lie about this? He also makes strange statements on how it can be &#8216;verified&#8217; that he was where he says he was later in the month; calling other people, etc. Frankly all Mr. Cohen would need to do would be to produce some credit card receipts or photographs of himself in the US. He has not done so, according to other journalists also working on substantiating the dossier.</p>
<h2>All Thanks to My Daughter&#8217;s Instagram</h2>
<p>Mr. Cohen told the world that we should examine his adult daughter&#8217;s instagram account, so I did just that. With the help of various people on Twitter, I was able to get precise dates on some of Ms. Cohen&#8217;s pictures.</p>
<p>One such picture <a href="https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/828814008295776256">she posted </a> showed that she boarded a flight back to the United States on January 2nd. (If it was indeed ever deleted, it is now back online). Prior to that, she had been in St. Bart&#8217;s. This was mildly interesting to me since Russians, and particularly Chelsea&#8217;s Roman Abramovitch, descend on St. Bart&#8217;s every Christmas.</p>

<p>The picture was taken from a window seat and showed a distinctive marking on the wingtip. I asked on Twitter if pilots or other aviation professionals could help me identify the plane. Immediately a number came forward to state that it was a Gulfstream, which they could tell by the positioning of the wing flaps relative to the rest of the wing. They further identified the plane as a G5, specifically. Shortly after that, somebody found the plane and found the tail number. It was N999LR.</p>
<p>I then researched the ownership of this plane. It was registered to &#8216;Beauty LLC&#8217;. Through ordinary flight trackers I could determine that she had flown from St. Maarten to HPN, a small airport in Westchester. There was quite a bit of diving into &#8216;Beauty LLC&#8217;. At first they appeared to be something to do with Cohen, as they were registered in the same building as some of his companies. But Beauty LLC owned several planes in its fleet. I started to wonder how Mr. Cohen, doubtless a successful lawyer, could be rich enough to own not one but several private jets.</p>
<p>The small airport where the jets live, HPN, is next to a ConAir facility and also, I am told, although I have not yet checked this out, one of Donald Trump&#8217;s golf courses. It appeared to be more probable that the planes were owned by ConAir and that (although common) the &#8216;LR&#8217; at the end of the tail number might stand for &#8216;Leandro Rizutto&#8217;, the owner of ConAir.</p>
<p>I put this question to Mr. Cohen on Twitter and his reply was most helpful. S<a href="https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/828814008295776256">howing him a screengrab of his daughter&#8217;s  Instagram picture,</a> I asked him how often he flew Mr. Rizutto&#8217;s planes out of the country. I also asked Cohen where he was between August 19th and August 22nd. He had given wrongful information to Rosie Gray that he was in LA from the 23rd August, when in fact, his TL showed him tweeting from Newark on the 24th. His timeline on Twitter also geotagged one tweet late on the 19th August and another on the 22nd August. I asked him:</p>
<blockquote><p>You know when you told us all to look at your daughter&#8217;s instagram? We did. Where were you August 19-22? <a class="twitter-hashtag pretty-link js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LeandroRizutto?src=hash"><s>#</s><b>LeandroRizutto</b></a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelCohen212/status/828815171493720065">Mr. Cohen replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>.<a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch"><s>@</s><b>LouiseMensch</b></a> in Los Angeles&#8230;verified by the press. This picture was taken in January, 2017</p></blockquote>
<p>That was fascinating. I had tagged my tweet #LeandroRizutto and Cohen did not dispute my identification of this plane. Furthermore, his tweet was utterly perplexing to me. He said that his whereabouts &#8220;August 19-22&#8221; had been verified by the press, but they had not been. His (false) statement to the Atlantic only claimed (wrongly) that he was in LA from the 23rd onwards. He had tweeted from Newark on the 24th. Why would Cohen say that? on August 19th, late, he was tweeting with geolocation from Manhattan, NY (and therefore could not have been in Los Angeles). On the 22nd, again, he is geolocated by a tweet from Manhattan,New York. So he was not &#8220;in Los Angeles&#8221; nor could &#8220;the press&#8221; verify something his own Twitter adamantly contradicted.</p>
<p>Based on my knowledge of men in general, I would venture to argue that they are creatures of habit. If Mr. Cohen, who in some way seemed to be linked to Beauty Central, had flown Rizutto&#8217;s G5 (assuming my guess was correct, and Cohen did not contradict it) back from vaycay in St. Bart&#8217;s, was it not probable he&#8217;d flown with him before?</p>
<p>Planes, too, loomed large in the overall story of the Trump camp&#8217;s alleged collusion with Russia. Dimity Rybolovev&#8217;s plane had landed for what quite clearly seemed to be tarmac meetings with the Trump camp in Charlotte, NC, on Nov 3; Las Vegas, Nevada; and . Rybolvev&#8217;s plane MKATE had also been parked in the Hamptons when the Cohen family appeared to be in residence there.</p>
<h3>Asking Mr. Cohen About A Flight to the Bahamas, August 19-22</h3>
<p>I pulled the flight history for two planes that were still active in the same fleet. N999LR &#8211; a G5, the plane that appeared in Mr. Cohen&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s instagram &#8211; showed a curious gap in its flight history in August, all the way through to late September, of which more later.</p>
<p>N555LR, the G4, had however flown to the Bahamas on August 19 taking the flight path HPN-FOK-Nassau. She returned August 22nd the same route. This broadly fits the gap in Mr. Cohen&#8217;s Twitter timeline, although one tweet shows as being geolocated in Manhattan after the outbound flight. I asked Mr. Cohen if he had been on that flight. He had answered me that he was in Los Angeles on 19-22nd, but his Twitter timeline shows he was not. I put this question to him whether he took either flight to or from the Bahamas in that period. He has not responded and later blocked me on Twitter.</p>
<p>I do not assert that Mr. Cohen was on that flight. The allegation against him made in the dossier is, however, a legitimate one for journalists to investigate. I believe that the issue of passports and &#8216;another Michael Cohen&#8217; is a red herring. Mr. Cohen is accused of having met with Russian intelligence, and it is highly likely that were this to be true, the Russians could get him in and out of America without a passport being stamped at all.</p>
<p>My theory of how this might have happened is as follows. Mr. Cohen would have taken the flight out, possibly being picked up in West Hampton at the FOK stop. In the Bahamas, he would have disembarked on the tarmac and boarded another plane &#8211; rather as MKate arranged tarmac meetings. This plane would have flown him to the EU or to Russia, where he would either have not disembarked at all, meeting somebody on board the plane, or disembarked using fake documents provided by Russia, diplomatic cover, a bribe to a guard at a friendly private airport or any number of other ruses by which a state spying actor could disembark an asset. He would have arranged some kind of payment, as the dossier alleges, and then got back on the plane, landed in Nassau, and taken N555LR back to FOK and/or HPN.</p>
<p>Indeed, the limits on this analysis are only bounded by two geolocated tweets from Manhattan on the 19th and 22. Had Mr. Cohen handed his phone to somebody else to place those tweets for him, he could have boarded the plane on the 19th and spent longer in the EU or Russia, returning to Newark airport on the morning of the 24th in order to catch his flight to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>I strongly suspect that Mr. Cohen did really have the use of his own phone by the 24th, if only because he made that obvious error in stating that he had been in Los Angeles on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Later Mr. Cohen backtracked to me blustering that Newark was an airport and that he had flown Virgin to his daughter in LA &#8211; presumably verifiable. But he told Rosie Gray he was in Los Angeles on the 23rd and he asserted to me he was in Los Angeles on 19-22nd. What plane did he take there on the 19th, then? If I were the FBI I would ask that question.</p>
<h2>Hiding the Planes, Or Planes in Plane Sight?</h2>
<p>Separately to the issue of Mr. Cohen&#8217;s whereabouts as asserted vs his Twitter timeline, August 19 &#8211; 24th inclusive, I had become interested in the planes of Beauty LLC.</p>
<p>Again, I make no assertion that Mr. Cohen did indeed fly to the Bahamas on August 19-22nd on N555LR. But as a journalist, I am interested in exploring the theory of how it might have happened, and if so, what that implied.</p>
<p>In the entirely theoretical situation in which this fleet of planes carried Cohen to the first leg of a clandestine meeting with Russian intelligence they would repay looking at.</p>
<p>So I looked.</p>
<p>What follows owes a great deal to a number of patriotic aviation professionals current and former who assisted me on Twitter and whom I will credit in an update to this article if I receive their permissions.</p>
<p>The first thing noted by almost everybody was that there was an improbably large gap in the flight history of the GV, N999LR. This gap covered August and September 2016. Those are, of course, the dates that the Steele dossier alleges there were meetings with the Trump camp and Russia.</p>
<p>I make no allegation here of malfeasance on the part of Beauty LLC, its owners, or anybody else. I plan simply to report the unusual facts that I found in public records and to allow intelligence professionals and mainstream media journalists with more resources than I have to investigate whether or not what I report here has a simple and innocuous explanation, which it may well do, or not.</p>
<p>The flight histories of all planes in the fleet were made private soon after I started asking public questions about them. That could easily be, of course, simply because private jet owners and charter users prefer privacy. Nonetheless I continued to look.</p>
<p>Aircraft are identified by a number of markers. The N-number, which can be changed; the serial number of the aircraft; and the S-code number or number of the transponder.</p>
<p>Looking at the current and former fleet of Beauty Central LLC I discovered the three following odd things, which I will the evidence of in a postscript in order to get to the meat of my possibly relevant (and possibly not relevant) discovery:</p>
<ol>
<li>The N-Number N450GA, a G1V, was shown as registered to Beauty Central and then to two other registrants. All of those planes had different serial numbers listed in the database. All, however, shared the identical S-Code transponder number.</li>
<li>The N-number N33LR was used in Beauty Central for two entirely separate planes; a GV with serial number 5031, and a GIV with serial number 1495. However, these two entirely separate planes were listed in the database as sharing one S-Code transponder number.</li>
<li>A GV with the serial number 5031 was listed as registered to Beauty Central LLC on August 3, 2016. Its N-number was N795BA. However, this GV 5031 had a **different transponder S-Code number ** than when GV 5031 was named N33LR, see above.</li>
<li>N795BA&#8217;s last trackable flight was on August 12, after which, she goes dark.</li>
<li>When one of my volunteer patriot researchers, who had first seen N450GA listed in Beauty Central LLC&#8217;s fleet as a former plane of their with status &#8216;inactive&#8217; looked again, she found that it no longer appeared for her in the list:</li>

<p>This was sufficient to start tracking every plane in the fleet, current or former. To be clear, as I have said, there may well be an innocent explanation. But it is at the least <em>unusual </em>to have two different aircraft sharing the same transponder S-Code &#8211; and for one of those aircraft, the GV, serial number 5031, that became N795BA after being N33LR, to switch transponder numbers between incarnations.</p>
<p>Since  I had a gap in August from August 12th on in the G5(s) N999LR, N795BA and N33LR, I chose to look &#8211; and was alerted to &#8211; the flights of N450GA.</p>
<p>Readers who are not already dead from boredom will recall that what was odd about N450GA is that although the N-Number appeared to leave Beauty Central&#8217;s fleet, and be assigned to two other companies&#8217; planes with different serial numbers, the S-Code transponder number was always the same. Furthermore, N450GA showed flights in the same period that the GV/s of Beauty Central &#8211; N999LR and N795BA &#8211; showed no flights.</p>
<p>Therefore I will report what trackers showed N450GA did in that period. I make no allegation that Mr. Cohen or Beauty Central had anything to do with these flights, but they are worth investigation based on my reporting about what appears to be unusual data on the registrations of the fleet.</p>
<p>On August 12, she flew from Detroit to Halifax. On August 13, from Halifax to Lyon, in France. On August 14th, she flew, according to records, from just outside Florence to just outside Moscow. (There does not appear to be any record of the flight from Lyon to Florence). And on August 15th, she flew from Moscow to remote Wyoming, to Bow National Forest.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: a pilot tells me the plane did not stop in Wyoming but flew to San Jose:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Probably not significant, but N450GA does not end in Wyoming on 8/15. In my data, the track is lost temporarily (2245Z-2330Z) 45,000 ft above Provo, Utah, picks up again above Nevada and lands in San Jose, CA.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is, thus far, what my researches have shown. It certainly does not prove Mr. Cohen went to the Bahamas or met with anybody in Moscow. But as he was not where he said he was, and as he is keen to pretend that Twitter data can alone prove whereabouts, I believe that it is worth asking about.</p>
<h3>Mr. Cohen&#8217;s Apparent Relationship With Pro-Russian Twitter Trolls Fits One Allegation Made in the Dossier</h3>
<p>When I started talking to Mr. Cohen on Twitter asking about his whereabouts on August 19-22, immediately a bunch of <a href="https://twitter.com/ElliotRapp/status/828816123432955905">fake Putinbot</a> accounts, some with Ukranian IP addresses, started to @ me. Mr. Cohen would also himself <a href="https://twitter.com/trmillennial/status/828809731473039361">RT these accounts.</a> In particular <a href="https://twitter.com/Da_federatsiya/status/828956509732216832">they started making excuses for Cohen</a>&#8216;s whereabouts. One <a href="https://twitter.com/Belous_SR/status/829004596022484992">Russian troll RTed things</a> like this. The dossier alleges that Mr. Cohen paid a company that ran a bot net out of Russia, which infected Democrats and others with viruses. He certainly regularly retweets Putinbots who seem to know him well, and to be directly connected to the Trump administration.  He said to me he would <a href="https://twitter.com/Da_federatsiya/status/828830705266331648">meet me around the first week of March</a>. Others <a href="https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/828821679359012866">tweeted and instantly deleted</a> that Cohen was at a Chris Christie fundraiser when he said he was in LA.</p>

<p>This same Putinbot a<a href="https://twitter.com/GoydUp/status/819468873753690112">ccount tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/MichaelCohen212"><s>@</s><b>MichaelCohen212</b></a> is an amazing man who has done an amazing job! lots of behind the scenes work getting us President Trump!</p></blockquote>
<p>Under this, there was a gif of Vladimir Putin clapping.</p>
<p>If Mr. Cohen comes back to me with a substantive reply on August 19-22 that is not wrong on its face, I will update this post.</p>

	<h1><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;"><a style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3727178-U-S-v-Anthony-Weiner-Plea-Agreement.html">Corrected</a> </span>And Updated in Light of Weiner&#8217;s Crime:</span></h1>
<p>It is very important to correct things that are wrong. I have two major corrections to make to my theory, articulated in this story, following<span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3727178-U-S-v-Anthony-Weiner-Plea-Agreement.html"><strong> Anthony Weiner&#8217;s guilty plea</strong></a></span> to one count of <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/united-states-of-america-v-anthony-weiner-court-documents-1.13649048">transferring obscene material to a minor</a> </span>and also of <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>&#8220;<a style="color:#ff0000;" href="http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/united-states-of-america-v-anthony-weiner-court-documents-1.13649048">attempting&#8221; to do so</a>. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>The firs</strong>t</span> is that Weiner did indeed, by his own account and that of prosecutors, transfer sexual material to a minor. The plea deal document said this happened &#8216;in 2016&#8217;. Therefore, all the following must be true, and I was wrong about them: Weiner did sext with a minor; the case was not invented, there was a real crime, with a real girl.</p>
<p>That is a fact. This article was a theory, written as such. And that theory has been proven partly <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/united-states-of-america-v-anthony-weiner-court-documents-1.13649048"><strong>wrong by the facts, which I must acknowledge with prominence.</strong></a></span> There was a real crime and a very serious one.</p>
<p>No 15 year old girl should ever have to undergo abusive contact by a predator like Weiner. Nor is she in <em>any way whatsoever</em> responsible for any actions by other adults. She is a pure victim.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>The second</strong></span> thing I want to correct in this story is my blame on ADA Dana Boente.  President Obama removed him from the line of succession. This now appears to have been a clever and successful feint into trapping Trump into reappointing Boente. He clearly has the trust of Director Comey and DUSA Rosenstein, and therefore has mine. I apologize fulsomely to him.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the story goes, it is vital to emphasize, and I do, that if men pretended that they were an abuse victim, that is on them and them alone. Such actions, showing intent, would <em>add to Weiner&#8217;s guilt and not diminish it</em>. If grown men faked any thing, as coming from an underage victim of crime, that, again, is on them, and not in any way whatsoever on the victim of the crime.</p>
<h2>The Carolina Conspiracy Remains My Theory, Although Founded on a Real Crime</h2>
<p>I also want to be clear, however, that I am not correcting, or altering, my overall theory in this article on Trump and Russia. I believe based on all the evidence that Mr. Weiner <em>also</em> sexted and emailed with grown men who were not the real girl he factually abused, but whom he <em>thought</em> were that same girl.</p>
<p>I believe, based on the evidence of the<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring"><strong> indictment by the FBI of Nikulin in Federal Court in October 2016,</strong></a> that he used Formspring to plant a virus on Anthony Weiner&#8217;s computer and sway the election. From none of that do I resile. Weiner is a predator and a true crime took place with an underage victim. That does not exclude the rest of these events happening, and the<a href="http://praguemonitor.com/2017/05/12/court-adjourns-hearing-russian-hackers-extradition"><strong> FBI charge of Nikulin supports it.</strong></a> Thus, the thrust of the theory of a conspiracy in South Carolina, by <a href="http://praguemonitor.com/2017/05/12/court-adjourns-hearing-russian-hackers-extradition">hackers allied with Donald Trump and with Russia,</a> to enable the seizure of Weiner&#8217;s computer, and to throw the election, remains. The fact is this conspiracy was enabled by a real offense of Weiner&#8217;s, it appears from his plea in court (as best I understand it). I have altered the text below to reflect the reality of that predatory offense.</p>
<h3>How Vladimir Putin Catfished A US Election With the Collusion of Team Trump</h3>
<p>Did Russia use a criminal case against Anthony Weiner &#8211; so their hacker Nikulin could plant Hillary’s emails on his computer?</p>
<p>It was the Comey letter that handed the election to Trump. Even if corrupt elements in the FBI Field Office in New York, penetrated by Russia, forced Comey&#8217;s hand &#8211;  even if Russian hacker Nikulin <em>did </em>plant emails on Anthony Weiner&#8217;s computer &#8211; there had to be a separate criminal case in the first place for the NYPD and FBI to go looking. I thought there was not &#8211; as above, I was wrong.</p>
<p>Did Vladimir Putin direct an attack  by a hardened group of adult hackers from North Carolina who penetrated the emails of Director Brennan of the CIA, and doxed and attacked hundreds of FBI and law enforcement personnel?</p>
<p class="p1">In this story I exclusively report the connections between the USSR-CWA hacker group of North Carolina ‘Crackas With Attitude’ and the sexts with, ostensibly, a 15 year old girl from Gaston, North Carolina, who had early in 2016 been a genuine victim of Weiner&#8217;s predatory behavior. That started the chain of events that led to James Comey’s forced letter to Congress, including the fact that the an email to Weiner ostensibly written by his earlier victim  is in fact a series of plagiarized texts it is unlikely any 15 year old girl has read, including works by J.D. Salinger, David Foster Wallace, Charles Bukowski, and &#8211; yes &#8211; “Fight Club” by Chuck Palahniuk.</p>
<p class="p1">There is also direct evidence that members of the Trump campaign were involved in this conspiracy and knew in advance what was coming &#8211; including Lara Trump, who visited Gaston, North Carolina, some days before she promised an ‘October surprise’ and ’tricks up our sleeve.’</p>
<h3 class="p1">Russia’s Hacker Nikulin, Formspring, and Anthony Weiner</h3>
<p class="p1">Russia, I believe, manipulated chain of events that forced James Comey’s letter to Congress. All available data shows that it was the timing of this letter that handed the election to Donald Trump. On November 3<span class="s1"><sup>rd</sup></span>, just before the election, the Russian plane MKATE and Putin’s bagman Rybolovev met Donald Trump’s campaign plane on the tarmac at Charlotte, North Carolina. By that time, events in North Carolina had swung the election to Mr. Trump.</p>
<p class="p1">In my first piece of work at Patribotics I laid out a unified theory on Russian active measures against the United States, including as part of it that Russia has a team of influencers inside the FBI Field Office in New York (the criminal division) and I regret to say, the NYPD, who work directly with Rudy Giuliani and General Flynn.</p>
<p class="p1">I drew readers’ attention to the arrest in Prague of the Russian hacker, Yvgeny Nikulin. He was indicted on charges of hacking Dropbox, Linked in and Formspring in 2012-2013.</p>
<p class="p1">Formspring is the little-known sexting app that Anthony Weiner used for his sexting the first time around.</p>
<p class="p1">My theory was that Nikulin, on instructions from the Russian state, “woke” or “planted”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a laptop of Anthony Weiner’s via a virus which he placed on it through his prior hack of Formspring, and alerted Russia’s moles and agents of influence in the FBI field office in New York, who subsequently “leaked” to all and sundry that the emails had been found, and, by Rudy Giuliani’s own testimony, pressured James Comey into sending the letter he did.</p>
<p class="p1">However, the emails were &#8211; nonetheless-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>found as part of an unrelated criminal investigation into Weiner’s sexting with a 15 year old girl. The story of these “sexts” broke Sep 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span> in the Daily Mail with a byline from Alana Goodman.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Who Was Weiner Actually Talking To?</h3>
<p class="p1">I can exclusively report that there is ample evidence that suggests that Weiner was sexting not only with a 15 year old girl,   but, <strong><a href="http://archive.is/aZziR">later and separately with hackers, </a></strong><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring">working for Russia</a>, including the North Carolina hacking group ‘Crackas With Attitude’, who hacked the head of the CIA, and a great many FBI agents, police officers, and other law enforcement officials.</p>
<p class="p1">There is evidence linking Russia’s propaganda outlet Sputnik to both acts of hacking; and there is, therefore, grave reason to be concerned about Trump’s choice of Dana Boente as Jeff Sessions’ second-in-command at the Justice Department. Which he now is. For in a little-noticed Executive Order released this weekend, Trump altered the order of succession at the Justice Department in order to make Boente second to Sessions.</p>
<p class="p1">Two of the Americans involved in Crackas With Attitude were arrested and took a guilty plea in December.</p>
<p class="p1">And one of the prosecuting AGs on that case? Dana Boente.</p>
<p class="p1">As I have previously reported, Jeff Sessions was placed by Trump as Attorney General, I believe, for the sole reason of protecting Trump from impeachment and prosecution in the matter of Russia’s hack on America. The placement of Boente as Sessions’ number two ought to raise yet another red flag. For Dana Boente is listed as AG on the North Carolina Crackas With Attitude case.</p>
<p class="p1">If I am right on the theory which I report here &#8211; that Crackas With Attitude conspired with Russian moles within the FBI and NY in New York, with the encouragement of Sputnik, to use a real criminal case against Anthony Weiner <i>in order that </i><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring">Russia’s Nikulin could plant Hillary Clinton’s emails</a> on Weiner’s now “discoverable” laptop &#8211; then Messrs Trump and Bannon, above all other things, need the CWA case to <i>go away really fast </i><span class="s2"><i>&#8211; </i>and now its prosecutor Dana Boente finds himself number two to Jeff Sessions in Trump&#8217;s Justice Department. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Thus far, the term ‘Russian hacking’ as it relates to the US elections has been understood by the mainstream media to mean two things: the hack of the DNC and Republican politicians’ emails, and the phishing attack on John Podesta, plus the subsequent release of emails obtained by those attacks through Russia’s puppet organization, Wikileaks. (To a lesser extent, the mainstream media also acknowledges that Russia backed and created a fleet of Twitter bots. They have not yet shown much sign of understanding that what is sloppily termed ‘fake news’ is in fact a coordinated Russian propaganda effort.)</p>
<p class="p1">But the Russian hack on the United States was, it seems far more direct than that.</p>
<p class="p1">It forced the Comey letter out of thin air. Using Weiner&#8217;s sleazebag tendencies, Russia used a real, underage victim of his sexts, to catfish Weiner into further communications actually written by an adult hacker, and thus used a real crime to commit a political hack on his computer. Then, with pliant moles in the NY FBI Field Office and NYPD, they seized his laptop. Nikulin planted Hillary&#8217;s emails upon it. Russian moles in the FBI Field Office leaked, tweeted and threatened &#8211; and even Lara Trump (from North Carolina) boasted in advance that the &#8216;October surprise&#8217; was coming.</p>
<p class="p1">From start to finish, Russia manipulated the Director of the FBI into sending his letter &#8211; which Jason Chaffetz leaked, by arrangement with the Trump camp, I believe, in order directly to swing the election to Donald Trump, Putin&#8217;s puppet.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Who Are Crackas With Attitude and How Do They Connect Weiner and Russia?</h3>
<p class="p1">The hacker group’s name, sources say, is a pun. The letters USA in Cyrillic look like the American letters “CWA”. Be that as it may, CWA involved an underage English hacker who was arrested, and subsequent to his arrest, two of his co-conspirators in North Carolina were also arrested. Their attack on the United States was exceptionally serious. It involved obtaining emails from the then Director of the CIA and doxing hundreds of United States law enforcement and intelligence personnel.</p>
<p class="p1">The 15 year old girl is also apparently from North Carolina, according to reports, and her father is an attorney.</p>
<p class="p1">However, I can exclusively report that there is extensive evidence online that some “sexts” were not written by that 15 year old girl, but by members of the hacking gang.</p>
<h3 class="p1">“You Got Catfished by a Dude”  &#8211; Or, The Infinite Jest of a Plagiarized Email</h3>
<p class="p1">It was no use Yvgeny Nikulin planting Hillary Clinton’s emails on Weiner’s computer, or even waking Weiner’s computer, on behalf of Russian assets in the FBI New York, unless they had a right to look at Weiner’s computer. For that to happen, Anthony Weiner had to have committed a <i>criminal offense </i>that would enable NYPD to have probable cause to go through his computers in the first place.</p>
<p class="p1">And for that, Nikulin used a crime against an underage victim to activate one of his own (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring">a previously implanted virus</a>).</p>
<p class="p1">All of Anthony Weiner’s sleazy sexting prior to this had been done with girls and women over the age of sexual consent. The youngest among them was 17 years old. In order for a case to be created, there needed to be an underage victim &#8211; and now, contrary to my earlier theory, we know there was one. It seems evident that just such an operation was planned by Russia; to use a victim in a criminal case, to allow Weiner’s computers to be seized and for Nikulin to thereafter plant his emails via Formspring.</p>
<p class="p1">According to the “breaking story” of September 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span>, by Alana Goodman in the Daily Mail, this girl had begun to sext with Weiner in January 2016. Her original story is odd and convoluted in a number of respects.</p>
<p class="p1">Firstly, the story is dated September 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span>, but publishing dates on videos contained within the story appear to indicate that they were uploaded some six days earlier.</p>
<p class="p1">Secondly, the story contains a report that Weiner “provided emails that he says proved he was the subject of a hoax” but the journalist does not tell us <i>why </i>Mr. Weiner said these emails proved this.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, there is the one sentence: “You got catfished by a dude.”</p>
<p class="p1">But, I believe the 15 year old girl&#8217;s letter, as quoted, was not written by her.</p>
<p class="p1">It is full of plagiarized quotes from novels. A second letter, ostensibly written by her to James Comey, appears to contain an odd phrase used by Julia Hahn, a former Breitbart writer whom Steve Bannon brought into the White House, and Michelle Bachman.</p>
<p class="p1">The author of that letter not only <i>claims</i> to be a “dude” ‘catfishing’, that is to say, a hacker pretending to be a woman or girl in order to entrap, but “her” email contains the following passages:</p>
<p class="p1">1. “My posture was consciously congruent to the back of my chair” &#8211; from the opening of Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace</p>
<p class="p1">2. “We’re the middle children of history….” To the words “But we won’t.” &#8211; From Fight Club, Chuck Palahniuk</p>
<p class="p1">3. “Guilt is guilt. It doesn’t go away…” to the words “paralyzing you.” &#8211; From Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters and Seymour an Introduction, both by J.D. Salinger</p>
<p class="p1">4. “I was losing my soul….” To “…you still have a soul to lose.” &#8211; From Tales of Ordinary Madness, “A Dollar and Twenty Cents” by Charles Bukowski.</p>
<p class="p1">In the letter “she” signs off “Girl that lost her faith in America”. “Lost her faith in America” turns up both in a quote from Michelle Bachmann and a <a href="http://archive.is/3tsP1">Breitbart article by Julia Hahn.</a></p>
<p class="p1">The above is the classic signature of a cat-fishing attempt. But there is plenty more online to connect this North Carolina teen with the Crackas With Attitude hack.</p>
<p class="p1">Just as Nikulin planted a virus using Weiner’s little known sexting app Formspring, in this case, Weiner had been using the little-known app Confide. <a href="http://archive.is/aZziR">Online, arch references</a> were <a href="http://archive.is/pkpR3">made</a><a href="http://archive.is/aZziR">  in advance</a> about the publication of Goodman’s article as to what was going on, using the word <a href="http://archive.is/aZziR">“Confide”</a>. Other accounts with ostensibly no knowledge of the case stated plainly that Weiner was <a href="http://archive.is/pkpR3">actually sexting with a 28 year old hacker</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the North Carolina Crackas With Attitude is Justin Liverman, who is around 28. His co-conspirator is one Andrew Otto Boggs. The two were arrested and pled guilty in January. As recently as two weeks ago, the FBI had confiscated their laptops and thumb drives.</p>
<h3 class="p1">CWA or USSR &#8211; The Hacking Group</h3>
<p class="p1">Hackers need not be Russian to work on behalf of Russia. In this case, CWA’s UK and US branches had close links to Sputnik, the Russian state owned propaganda channel. A ‘journalist’ called Cassandra Fairbanks, @CassandraRules, on Twitter, who was and probably is ‘active in the hacker community’, posted photographs of herself with Liverman and said she was raising money for his defense. And why not? Weren’t CWA just some young punks that got in over their heads?</p>
<p class="p1">The answer to that is no. The CWA hack managed to get into the emails of the director of the CIA. Executives at Sputnik pressured non-Russian staff to obtain these CIA emails and threatened them if they refused. However, it is almost certain that Sputnik already had the emails; as soon as American staff refused to release them, Wikileaks was handed them and put them out on the internet. The young boy, 15, in the UK, who had been tricked into doing a hack by and for adults, was conveniently too young to punish properly. But his fully adult co-conspirators were not. CWA’s North Carolina contingent used the same hack to dox FBI and law enforcement, mercilessly harassing American intelligence and police personnel, writing phone scripts that would ring officers on the hour through the hour through the night. Sputnik adopted Bernie Sanders and pro-Palestine colors when it wanted to defend the hackers.</p>
<p class="p1">Meanwhile, Ms. Fairbanks was promoting every anti-American hacker, defined by the IC as Russian state hackers, known to mankind. She “loved” Guccifer 2. She fangirled over Wikileaks and the Russian asset Julian Assange. Fairbanks also pushed out co-ordinated Russian propaganda from Infowars and others during the election, including pizzagate and other Russian-organized propaganda spread by Mike Flynn and other Russian agents of influence. But with CWA she held personal meetings, photographing herself with Liverman and helping fund his defense in court.</p>
<p class="p1">The Daily Mail, Sputnik, and Trump</p>
<p class="p1">There seems to be a strong friendship between the Daily Mail’s journalist Alana Goodman, who wrote the 15 year old girl story on which the criminal case was based, and Ms. Fairbanks of Sputnik. They photographed themselves on multiple occasions together in social settings, such as sabering bottles of champagne at Trump Tower. They defended each other on Twitter. Ms. Goodman appears in many tweeted photographs by Miss Fairbanks. At one debate, Miss Goodman stars in a photograph of herself wearing a ‘Make America Great’ cap pulled down over her head. Sputnik’s Miss Fairbanks points everybody to Goodman’s story on Weiner of the 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span>. Goodman is also apparently close to the Trump campaign’s Moishe Lee.</p>
<p class="p1">Sputnik’s Cassandra Fairbanks was also invited to the Inaugural Freedom Ball, which is quite an honor for a mouthpiece of the Russian state, and tweeted her pictures close to Trump and the First Lady. She followed this ostensibly unlikely triumph by spending New Year’s eve, too, with Miss Goodman (shortly after her photograph with Justin Liverman of CWA).</p>
<p class="p1">Yet while Ms. Fairbanks promoted Ms. Goodman’s exclusive on the 15 year old girl, on Twitter, her own organ, Sputnik, and <a href="http://rt.com">RT.com</a>, seemed awfully reticent to promote it<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&#8211; or even to touch it. Although both Russian channels covered the <i>preceding</i> Weiner scandal, involving the married Weiner, his young son in a photograph, and an adult woman, there was <i>no mention whatsoever </i>online on both Russian media channels of this story. Even though, ostensibly, it was the far more important one. Previously, all Anthony Weiner’s sexting had been done with overage women or girls over the age of consent. It was sleazy, and pathetic, certainly, and his wife, Huma Abedin, separated from him. But it was not criminal.</p>
<p class="p1">Russia and its spies within the FBI needed it to be criminal.</p>
<p class="p1">And yet RT and Sputnik showed an admirable, one might say inexplicable, level of restraint when confronted with the story of what appeared to be an <i>actual </i>crime by Weiner.</p>
<p class="p1">There are other disturbing notes to be made about the manner of the publication of the story. While it was reported as ‘breaking news’ on September 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span> by Miss Goodman, online dates on the videos embedded within the story appear to show they were shot six days earlier. Why was the story held, if indeed it was? On September 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span>, Eric Lichtblau, who would later publish a substantially false story at the New York Times saying that the FBI investigating Trump’s server ‘found no clear links to Trump’, alerted Alfa Bank with a question about their involvement with the server. At that point, Trump’s server went dark. It was certainly a most opportune time to publish a major distraction that could have major consequences.</p>
<p class="p1">Sputnik’s Miss Fairbanks also seemed to know that publication was imminent; she decided to pose in an arch t-shirt for Wikileaks that said ‘Publish or Perish’ which she said she was ‘wearing for traveling’.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Foreknowledge from the FBI NY, the NYPD, Lara Trump, Giuliani and Flynn</h3>
<p class="p1">It is by now well-known that now disgraced General Mike Flynn, and Rudy Giuliani, once a Secretary of State contender, boasted in advance of the ‘October surprise’ that was coming based on “emails discovered” on Weiner’s laptop as part of the “separate criminal case”. The FBI Field Office in New York, indeed, have hung themselves up nicely by leaking on Russia’s behalf to these people but also by tweeting from an account. Giuliani’s partner boasted that the NYPD was also corrupt; that if Director Comey did not write to Congress, the letter that handed the election to Trump, they, the NYPD, would call a press conference announcing all the ‘arrests’ they had made in the “Weiner sexting” case.</p>
<p class="p1">But, partly perhaps from sexism, partly from fear of attacking the first family, not enough attention has been paid to the Trump family’s <i>own </i>Carolina connection, and part in the conspiracy. Lara Yunaska, NC, now Lara Trump, NY, boasted on the radio, in advance, that an October surprise was coming &#8211; something she had no legal way of knowing. The FBI and NYPD are not supposed to leak information on criminal cases, particularly those ostensibly involving sexual abuse of a minor, to politicians for political purposes. Yet Mrs. Eric Trump was on the radio, bold as brass, saying on October 24 that ‘there are still a few days in October’ and ‘we’ve got a couple of things up our sleeve.’</p>
<p class="p1">On 29<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> October, when the Comey letter had been leaked by Jason Chaffetz, North Carolina native Lara Trump went further, saying on the radio to ABC’s Rita Cosby that <i>Trump </i>had “forced” Comey’s hand with the letter.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“</span><span class="s4"><i>I think my father-in-law forced their hand in this. You know, he has been the one since the beginning saying that she shouldn’t be able to run for president, and I commend him on that”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1">Lara Trump said.</p>
<p class="p1">These interviews followed her trip, with her husband Eric, to Gastonia, Gaston County, North Carolina. <a href="http://www.gastongazette.com/news/20161019/eric-and-lara-trump-to-campaign-for-donald-in-gastonia">According to the Gaston County Gazette</a>, Lara and Eric Trump visited the GOP headquarters there on October 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span>.</p>
<p class="p1">I tried to discover the identity of the real teenage girl and her father for this story (since both Ms. Goodman and Buzzfeed News claimed to have spoken to them). But I could not do so. I am glad now that I could not find out their identities.</p>

<h2>Update: Fri 12 May:</h2>
<p>There are rumors within the intelligence community that indictments are either being prepared, or presently exist, sealed, against the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. One source reports that Sessions may be arrested, or a case against him announced, later today, Friday March 12th. Although I cannot find another source at this late hour to agree, the RUMINT is interesting enough that I am passing it on to readers as an update to the below post, originally published on the day Sessions was confirmed as Attorney General.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; Original Article&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Jeff Sessions has just been confirmed. It is now incumbent on patriotic Republicans and Democrats, and, failing that, patriotic lawyers willing to bring cases, to demand that Sessions recuse himself from any and all investigations concerning Russian hacking of the election, the Department of Justice investigation into corruption and election interference by the FBI field office in New York and the NYPD, and any investigations involving Steve Bannon or Trump or Breitbart campaign staff, past or present.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Part One: Sessions &#8211; Suspect or Material Witness in Any Russian Hacking Inquiry</span></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Jeff Sessions Recruited Carter Page, Under FBI Investigation</strong></h2>
<p>Even those who are only loosely following the Russian hacking story must be aware of the names of Carter Page and Paul Manafort, and of the FISA warrant, which Ii reported was issued to the FBI’s counter-intelligence division in Connecticut on October 15, 2016, concerning the activity of the server in Trump Tower and of two Russian-linked banks, Alfa Bank and SVB (Silicon Valley Bank).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Jeff Sessions was first announced by the Trump campaign as its ‘National Security Adviser’. He was next announced by the Trump campaign as its ‘Foreign Policy Adviser.’ Senator Sessions has no experience in either of these areas of policy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On March 16</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, then Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told Newsmax that Jeff Sessions, personally, was putting together Trump’s foreign policy team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On March 21</span><span style="font-weight:400;">st</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, the Washington Post reported its interview with Trump in which he states that this list of foreign policy advisers includes Carter Page. The transcript is not perfectly accurate. If one listens to the audio recording at the top of the article, however, Trump says: ‘Give me the list, Corey [Lewandowski], so I can be a little more accurate here.’ He then reads the names from a piece of paper, explaining the odd cadence (as written) of ‘Carter Page, PhD,’ which is not how one normally announces the name of a team member, but does reflect how Page might be described on a written list.</span></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1396" data-permalink="https://patribotics.blog/2017/02/07/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-suspect/dan4-2/" data-orig-file="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg?w=845" data-orig-size="585,448" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Dan4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg?w=845?w=300" data-large-file="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg?w=845?w=585" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1396" src="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg?w=845" alt="Dan4.jpeg" srcset="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg 585w, https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px"   /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This detail suggests that Trump himself knew little of Page. Miller is on the record as saying that Jeff Sessions is putting the team together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Carter Page had absolutely no, zero, foreign policy experience. This odd choice was remarked upon at the time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Senator Sessions must explain why he chose Carter Page, who went to Russia in July and reportedly met with <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/the-mystery-of-trumps-man-in-moscow-214283">Sechin on sanctions and the head of Russian intelligence, Igor Diveykin, charged with hacking America&#8217;s election</a>.</span></p>
<p>Politico reported that <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/the-mystery-of-trumps-man-in-moscow-214283">Carter Page also met Sergei Ivanov, &#8220;until recently Putin&#8217;s Chief of Staff&#8221;.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/26/Editorial-Opinion/Graphics/2016.09.25_FBI_letter.pdf?tid=a_inl">Senator Sessions must answer if he had any input into</a>, or oversight of,<a href="https://twitter.com/gopisascam/status/826997997103755266"> Carter Page’s letter to Director Comey of (September)</a>, in which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/26/Editorial-Opinion/Graphics/2016.09.25_FBI_letter.pdf?tid=a_inl">Page carefully says</a>:</span></p>

<p>Yet for the record, I have not met this year with any sanctioned official in Russia despite the fact that there are no restrictions on U.S. persons speaking with such individuals</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This language is so carefully parsed, that Carter Page could have met</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Sanctioned Russians working for the Russian government, who are not officials, in Russia, in 2016 &#8211; that would include Sergei Ivanov</li>
<li>Sanctioned Russian officials, in 2016, outside of Russia</li>
<li>Any Russian person on the sanctions list, including officials, in Russia up to the end of December 2015, for example at the RT.com dinner at which Mike Flynn was present</li>
<li>Any Russians whatever including Putin himself outside of Russia in 2016.</li>
</ol>
<p>Carter Page (in regards to the Alfa Bank server) has or had &#8216;an office around the corner from Trump Tower&#8217;. And these are only the top lines of his suspicious contact and total lack of qualifications, to have been chosen by Sessions.</p>
<p>Jeff Sessions must answer for his recruitment of one of the FBI&#8217;s top suspects in Russia&#8217;s hack on America, believed also to have offered to lift sanctions in exchange for assistance to Trump in the election; and who features in the Steele dossier.</p>
<h2>Jeff Sessions Is Connected to Alfa Bank, Named in Comey&#8217;s FISA Warrant</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Jeff Sessions is deeply connected to Alfa Bank, one of the banks named in the FISA Court’s October warrant. His chief of staff Richard Burt is a lobbyist for Alfa Bank. According to the Steele dossier, Trump was required to switch positions on Ukraine in exchange for intelligence. This happened in April, according to the dossier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">April is when Paul Manafort joined the campaign as its manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">April 17 is when Richard Burt, Alfa Bank lobbyist and Jeff Sessions chief of staff, wrote a Trump speech that did just what the Steele dossier requested Trump do. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/Trump-Campaign-Denies-Ties-Russia/2016/10/07/id/752155/"><span style="font-weight:400;">http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/Trump-Campaign-Denies-Ties-Russia/2016/10/07/id/752155/</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nor did it stop there. <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/Trump-Campaign-Denies-Ties-Russia/2016/10/07/id/752155/">Alfa Bank’s Mr. Burt</a>, whom, like Carter Page, <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/Trump-Campaign-Denies-Ties-Russia/2016/10/07/id/752155/">the Trump camp tried to wash its hands of, denying contact</a>, continued to advise Jeff Sessions during the summer and wrote policy papers for him. Newsmax <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/Trump-Campaign-Denies-Ties-Russia/2016/10/07/id/752155/">reports</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight:400;">“while the <strong>Trump campaign denies Burt&#8217;s involvement</strong>, the lobbyist &#8230; was <strong>invited to attend dinners hosted by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions</strong>, Trump&#8217;s <strong>national security committee chairman, to discuss national security and foreign policy. Burt and another source told Politico that he also wrote white papers for Sessions on those subjects</strong>.” Burt said “he delivered his advice through an intermediary, whom he would not name”. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But Mr. Burt was in the direct pay of Alfa Bank. Sessions must name that intermediary.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Sessions is directly responsible then for three of the most crucial things in any criminal, intelligence or Congressional investigation Russian hacking of the election: the recruitment of Carter Page, Trump’s shift in foreign policy towards Ukraine and Russia, directly matching the time and the substance as reported in the Steele dossier to be ‘payment’ for Russian hacking, and for deep connections to Alfa Bank, on which the FBI FISA warrant was finally granted. He would be both a suspect, and a key witness. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Part Two: Jeff Sessions Must Not Prevent Criminal FBI, DOJ Inquiries Into His Friends and Colleagues</span></strong></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Sessions Must Extradite Nikulin, Russian Hacker Who Attacked Anthony Wiener’s Computer</span></h2>
<p>Jeff Sessions as Attorney General would be in the position of prosecuting, or not, Yvgeny Nikulin, the Russian hacker <strong>who connects Russia’s attack on America and the sedition of the FBI Field Office in New York.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Elements within the NYPD and the FBI Field Office in New York are suspected of criminal conspiracy with Donald Trump and his electoral team, including, but not limited to, the National Security Adviser General Mike Flynn, Rudy Giuliani, and <a href="https://twitter.com/JaneSays10/status/823424249742303232">Lara Trump, the wife of Eric Trump.</a>  </span></p>
<p>Before the release of Director Comey&#8217;s election-altering letter, which was wrongfully, perhaps criminally, leaked by Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the following people had boasted in advance that the FBI Field Office in New York and the NYPD were leaking to them about &#8220;criminal inquiries&#8221; into both Wiener and the Clinton Foundation, and that they had &#8220;a surprise&#8221; coming, which would alter the political course of the election:</p>
<p>General Mike Flynn, National Security Adviser</p>
<p>Rudy Giuliani, legally advising the President</p>
<p>Lara Trump</p>
<p>and others.</p>
<p>Mr. Nikulin was picked up on October 5th in Prague on an FBI Red Warrant. That is exceptionally serious. He has still not been extradited. His indictment, issued October 21, states that he &#8216;transmitted a code&#8217; to a computer and mentions that he hacked, with admin credentials, LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring.</p>
<p>Formspring is the application Anthony Wiener first used for sexting. It closed altogether in 2014</p>
<p>There is clearly every likelihood that Nikulin &#8220;woke&#8221; Anthony Wiener&#8217;s old computer and activated or planted copies of emails upon it. The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring">DoJ indictment states</a> that</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the indictment, the defendant also caused damage to computers belonging to a LinkedIn employee and <strong>to Formspring by transmitting a program, information, code, or command.</strong>  Nikulin also is alleged to have <strong>used the credentials of LinkedIn and Formspring employees in connection with the computer intrusions</strong>.  Further, Nikulin is alleged to have <strong>engaged in a conspiracy with unnamed co-conspirators to traffic stolen Formspring user credentials</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did you get that?</p>
<p>&#8220;Nikulin is alleged to have <strong>engaged in a conspiracy with unnamed co-conspirators to traffic stolen Formspring user credentials&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>That means a Russian hacker traded credentials of Anthony Wiener, to whom?</p>
<p>The indictment further states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nikulin was arrested on Oct. 5 by officials in the Czech Republic pursuant to an Interpol Red Notice based on a warrant issued in connection with a criminal complaint. He remains in custody in Prague, Czech Republic.</p></blockquote>
<p>My theory, to be explicit, is that Russian hackers, working with and for the Trump campaign, handed over Anthony Weiner&#8217;s sexting credentials; that emails were planted on his computer: that the FBI and NYPD elements in New York (Field Office) boasted to the Trump camp they had an &#8220;October Surprise&#8221; coming: and they forced Director Comey to reveal his private letter.</p>
<p>Is Jeff Sessions going to bring home to America this accused criminal, Nikulin, taken in Prague on an ultra-serious Interpol Red Notice, when Nikulin could indict all his friends and colleagues on the Trump campaign?</p>
<p>Will Congress and those Republicans who trust Sessions force him to do this?</p>
<p>Will Sessions try to dismiss the extradition of the hackers Comey has picked up abroad? Will he try to prevent deep prosecution of Nikulin? Will he tread on the extant six-agency taskforce, or refuse to recuse himself, a suspect, in Russian hacking?</p>
<p>It is saddening to me that patriot Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham are voting yes on Jeff Sessions because they know him, when Sessions, for deniability, <em>refused to read </em>the Russian hacking report.</p>
<p>They should limit his power as AG &#8211; or lawyers with conflict of interest specialities should go to the courts to remove him.</p>
