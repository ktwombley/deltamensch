	<div class="entry-content">
	<p>Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak&#8217;s phone was both hacked and turned into a &#8216;hot mike&#8217; for recording conversations by a Five Eyes intelligence agency,</p>
<p>Sources with links to Western intelligence report that a similar &#8216;SS7&#8217; exploit as that used by consent on the phones of James Comey, and other FBI agents, by the FBI and Justice Department, was placed on the phone of Sergei Kislyak &#8211; most certainly without consent &#8211; and that the Russian Ambassador to the US not only had his phone bugged, but that his phone was being used as a microphone to record those with whom he was speaking.</p>
<p>Sources do not say when the exploit was placed on Kislyak&#8217;s phone. One source speculated that Ambassador Kislyak had only survived in his position in America &#8216;because of optics&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Five Eyes intelligence agreement prevents members of the world&#8217;s premier intelligence alliance &#8211; America, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom &#8211; from spying on each other&#8217;s territories and citizens. However, crucially, embassies, such as those of Ecuador in London and Russia in Washington DC, are regarded as sovereign territory of their native countries. The NSA is free to spy within the Ecuadorean embassy in London, and GCHQ, its British equivalent, is free to spy within Russia&#8217;s embassy in DC. The Five Eyes alliance is the closest intelligence partnership in the world. Recently Canada assisted DGSE, France&#8217;s CIA, in spying on Rebel Media on behalf of M. Macron, the then French Presidential candidate. Sources report that both the FBI, NSA and Britain&#8217;s GCHQ assisted Canada in this operation, because of the involvement of the Trump-Russia partisan Jack Posobiec.</p>
<p>In his testimony to the Senate today, Jeff Sessions, who <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/02/07/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-suspect/">as Patribotics reported in February,</a> was a suspect in the Trump Russia hack, suddenly changed his tune, admitting that he &#8220;might have&#8221; had a conversation with Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel.</p>
<p>As<a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/04/16/carter-page-went-to-moscow-with-a-tape-of-donald-trump-offering-treason-for-hacking/"> I reported exclusively earlier this year, </a>Page, Manafort, Epshteyn and Kislyak, along possibly with Donald Trump himself, were <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/04/16/carter-page-went-to-moscow-with-a-tape-of-donald-trump-offering-treason-for-hacking/">recorded by US intelligence discussing the tape promising a policy shift in exchange for help with the elections,</a> at the Mayflower. If Sessions was there, he was recorded too. Sources with links to the U.S. intelligence community now report that the group of men played the tape that was to be played in Moscow by Page and then, literally, <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/04/16/carter-page-went-to-moscow-with-a-tape-of-donald-trump-offering-treason-for-hacking/">had a discussion</a> about trading it for hacking help, a discussion which is in the possession of <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/04/16/carter-page-went-to-moscow-with-a-tape-of-donald-trump-offering-treason-for-hacking/">US intelligence</a>. It is not known however if this tape was recorded via a Five Eyes SS7 exploit placed on Mr. Kislyak&#8217;s phone, or by normal surveillance of any Russian Ambassador on US soil that is always carried out by the American authorities.</p>
<p>Sources with links to Western intelligence would not give any details of when the exploit was placed or how long it had lasted.</p>

<p>Sources with links to US intelligence confirmed, as I <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/06/09/paul-ryan-taped-with-russian-ambassador-on-gop-money-laundering/">exclusively reported on Patribotics</a>, that Speaker <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/06/09/paul-ryan-taped-with-russian-ambassador-on-gop-money-laundering/">Paul Ryan was taped</a> speaking to Sergei Kislyak at the GOP Convention, as was Reince Priebus, agreeing to accept laundered or &#8216;dark&#8217; Russian funds for the GOP. Sources with links to the Justice Department earlier confirmed that <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/05/11/sources-russia-probe-means-president-hatch-rico-case-against-gop/">a RICO case is being prepared against the entire Republican party on the basis of Russian money</a> and intelligence, in the form of Wikileaks stories, being given to it as a body. Director Comey, who<a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/06/13/exclusive-director-comey-legally-taped-calls-meetings-with-trump/"> consensually allowed the SS7 exploit on his phone,</a> testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that Jeff Sessions would always have had to recuse himself on the Russia inquiry because <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/06/08/comey-day-meticulously-executed-testimony-was-counterintelligence-plan/">serious concerns were known to him, Comey,</a> about Sessions&#8217; conduct with Russia.</p>
<p>Mr. Sessions has always been a prime suspect in the Trump Russia inquiry, long before he was nominated as Attorney General, as I reported in February on the day of his confirmation. He will now be wondering &#8211; along with the Russians &#8211; just how much intelligence Five Eyes has managed to gather, and for how long, from Mr. Kislyak&#8217;s phone.</p>
<p>Western intelligence sources said that their motives for speaking on background on this matter were to warn Mr. Trump and his associates that further covering up or attacks on the U.S. intelligence community, particularly on Director Comey&#8217;s integrity, would not be tolerated. Laws governing intelligence &#8216;leaks&#8217; or whistleblowing do not apply to the sovereign allies of the United States, many of whom, both inside and outside Five Eyes, have hard signals intelligence on Donald Trump and his family. DGSE, who as a NATO ally outside Five Eyes are not prevented from spying on Americans by treaties, have recordings of Donald Trump Jr speaking to Russian intelligence in France, as one example.</p>
<p>Multiple, separate sources with links to the intelligence communities of more than one nation, used the phrase &#8216;gloves off&#8217; when describing the situation with Russia and Trump. Vladimir Putin has attempted to intervene in Brexit, in the French election and in elections all over Europe, and has personally exposed all of Russia, and that nation&#8217;s economy, to the intense rage of the far richer and more powerful Western world. Understanding the principle of &#8216;deniabilty,&#8217; intelligence sources inside and outside the US intelligence community have suggested that leaks of information by allied nations may serve US intelligence by freeing them from blowing the whistle themselves. Sources linked to one specific Five Eyes intelligence partner noted that &#8216;deniability&#8217; is designed to allow witnesses to tell the truth on the stand. If, theoretically, British intelligence sources were to disclose information on Mike Flynn &#8211; as retired MI6 head Sir Richard Dearlove did to the Financial Times &#8211; US intelligence would not be consulted, even through a back channel, these sources said.</p>
<blockquote><p>If whistleblowers wish to contact patribotics they are encouraged to get in touch on Twitter, or via the <a href="https://patribotics.blog/contact/"><strong>secure email</strong> </a>listed here</p></blockquote>
<p>Sources reported that Director Comey was regarded with affection throughout allied intelligence, and that Donald Trump&#8217;s scornful attitude towards NATO &#8211; since Trump is perceived as a mere proxy of Russia, without thought or direction of his own, by the west &#8211; has enraged allied intelligence services, who are more than prepared to judiciously release intelligence at strategic times (such as Mr. Sessions&#8217; testimony) to make it clear that Russia and Trump standing in the way of the FBI and Director Mueller&#8217;s inquiry will not be tolerated.</p>

	<p>EXCLUSIVE: Sources with links to the Justice Department confirm that U.S. intelligence has legal copies of all Donald Trump&#8217;s &#8220;tapes&#8221; of his meetings with Director Comey &#8211; and that Comey had his own phone legally hacked in order to record suspects, including Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, for over a year.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Patribotics hopes to expand our reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to <a href="http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch"><strong>donate</strong></a>, there are buttons around the site, or you could <strong><a href="http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch">make a contribution here. </a></strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>On June 9th, in the <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/new-york/nyedce/1:2017mc01679/402909/2/0.pdf?ts=1497095196">United States District Court of the Eastern District of New York</a>, Judge Orenstein slapped down Jeff Sessions as he attempted to force the service provider on James Comey&#8217;s phone to assist Sessions with continuing an SS7 exploit placed there by the consent of James Comey, and lawfully, in order to help Comey in his criminal investigation of Donald Trump and Russia.</p>
<p>Separate sources with links to the intelligence and justice communities are clear that the &#8216;witness&#8217; in this case is James Comey, the &#8216;software solution&#8217; is the SS7 exploit used on his phone by consent, and that his phone was recording, again, by consent, and as part of a lawful criminal investigation that included Donald Trump, all his conversations for well over a year. This would mean that the FBI had essentially used Director Comey&#8217;s cell phone to monitor suspects in the Trump Russia case since before the beginning of June, 2016. This is very, very bad news for Mr. Trump.  If Trump, as he is openly threatening, prepares to fire Special Counsel Mueller, parts of these tapes may be leaked to the general public. The court case itself, with the names of the witness and his cell phone provider redacted, is <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/new-york/nyedce/1:2017mc01679/402909/2/0.pdf?ts=1497095196">open, public record</a>, but sources linked to the intelligence community have confirmed the witness to be Director Comey, giving the document an extraordinary significance.</p>
<p>First we can see that the &#8216;hot mike&#8217; phone was provided to Director Comey by Federal Agents, in or before the summer of 2016, as part of a criminal investigation, and in order to assist him in that investigation:</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of an investigation into suspected criminal activity, the government has secured the agreement of the Witness to engage in monitored communications with subjects of the investigation. Beginning over a year ago, agents provided the Subject Telephone to the Witness, who in turn provided written consent to the interception and recording of all calls made and received over that device</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, we can see that Director Comey had renewed his written consent on this &#8216;several months later&#8217; and again just two days before Trump fired him. The day after this consent was renewed, Comey interviewed Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump about the Kelhios botnet operating out of Trump Tower, which they both had knowledge of.  This conversation too was legally recorded and likely was the immediate spur for Trump to obstruct justice by firing Comey.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Witness again provided <strong>written consent to the monitoring of the Subject Telephone</strong> several months later, and then <strong>did so a third time two days ago</strong>; in this most recent writing, according to the government, the Witness again committed &#8220;not [to] allow third parties to use the telephone.&#8221; Id. at 7 &amp; Ex. A.3</p></blockquote>
<p>It is clear that the government, by which we mean Jeff Sessions, submitted to the court that he needed help finding out how Director Comey&#8217;s cell phone had been monitored as the &#8220;software based solution&#8221; (ie, the SS7 hot mike of the phone) had been discontinued. Intelligence sources familiar with the matter were scornful of the idea that the consensual monitoring of Director Comey&#8217;s phone would be continued after he was fired for investigating Trump&#8217;s sons and the Kelhios botnet used in Russia&#8217;s hack of the U.S. election. (In point of fact, sources laughed aloud at the suggestion).</p>
<blockquote><p>Until recently, the agents consensually monitored the Subject Telephone&#8217;s communications and location by using &#8220;a software-based solution&#8221; that did not require the Provider&#8217;s participation. Id. at 7 n.6. The government reports that the latter product was recently &#8220;discontinued&#8221; without explaining how that discontinuance renders the product it was already using ineffective (although I assume that it must be so).</p></blockquote>
<p>The translation of this passage is that intelligence agents who consensually hacked the phone switched off their exploit the second Trump fired Comey, and Jeff Sessions was whining to the court that he could not get back in.</p>
<p>In the dry language of the ruling, judge Orenstein told Sessions that Comey was using this exploit to investigate a crime and that hacking his phone without consent was completely unnecessary. He told Sessions to go and boil his head.</p>
<blockquote><p>The third discretionary factor is necessity. In N.Y. Tel. Co., the Supreme Court observed that &#8220;without the Company&#8217;s assistance there is no conceivable way in which the surveillance authorized by the District Court could have been successfully accomplished.&#8221; 434 U.S. at 175. The record before me shows no such necessity. The government has demonstrated only that for over a year, it was able to monitor the Witness&#8217;s communications over the Subject Telephone without the Provider&#8217;s assistance, and that the particular product it used to do so has been discontinued. It has not asserted, much less established, that there are no other alternatives available that will allow it to accomplish its investigative goal without forcing the Provider to furnish technical assistance against its will. The complete lack of any showing of necessity weighs heavily against the government.</p></blockquote>
<p>The front-facing of Director Comey&#8217;s identity to Patribotics may be taken as a warning shot on Mueller. As I have previously reported, Donald Trump is under a criminal indictment, and Director Comey decided he himself might need to be fired in order to advance the narrative away from himself and towards Donald Trump&#8217;s criminal actions. Sources report the Articles of Impeachment being considered by the Judiciary Committee have now advanced further and the language of them is presently being worked upon for presentation to Congress, at which point, the criminal indictment granted against Trump will be made public.</p>
<p>Come for the Bishop, best not miss.</p>

<p>These sources report that Mr. Ryan is also on tape discussing how he can best use and disseminate Wikileaks material that was hacked from the DNC by Russia in order to win both his own election and election for Trump.</p>
<p>Further, sources say, the tape of Mr. Ryan discussing his knowledge of Russia funding the GOP that has previously been published in the Washington Post is in fact a small fragment of a much more damaging tape.</p>
<p>Patribotics exclusively broke the news of that tape  <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/05/11/sources-russia-probe-means-president-hatch-rico-case-against-gop/">one week before it was released</a> in the mainstream media. In this <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/05/11/sources-russia-probe-means-president-hatch-rico-case-against-gop/">story of May 11th</a> I reported:</p>
<blockquote><p>On <strong>Paul Ryan</strong>, Speaker of the House, normally third in the line of succession, I can report as fact that sources say that Ryan has been legally intercepted, and is on tape, admitting that he knew Russian money was being laundered into the Republican party. Without co-operation pending resignation Ryan may find himself swept up into <a href="https://twitter.com/jemillerwbal/status/862714093899325440">a RICO prosecution involving the apparatus of the Republican party</a> who accepted laundered Russian money.</p></blockquote>
<p>A week later Adam Entous at the Washington Post printed his exclusive report on the partial content of that tape.</p>
<p>My sources had clarified, at the time, that this tape was not the same as I had heard previously, namely, that Paul Ryan was directly on tape at the GOP convention discussing money laundering with the Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Reince Priebus was on tape doing so, these sources said.</p>
<p>Separate sources with links to the intelligence community and justice departments now confirm that there are at least two tapes of Speaker Ryan discussing Russian money, however. One is the tape that I reported and which the Washington Post published. The second, however, is indeed of Ryan speaking with Kislyak at the convention. Sources report that there is signals intelligence, or SIGINT, of Paul Ryan discussing Russian money reaching the GOP and being covered up through companies using the ruling on Citizens United. Further, there is signals intelligence connecting Ryan to discussions on how best to use hacked data from Wikileaks to benefit Trump&#8217;s campaign and his own as well as the GOP in general.</p>
<p>Sources with links to the intelligence community report a widespread belief that Mr. Ryan is being forced to act sympathetic towards Trump and dismissive of the Russian probe because Russia holds kompromat upon him. There is anger, these sources say, amongst rank and file intelligence agents at Paul Ryan&#8217;s gross defense of Trump and rank misstatements of Director Comey&#8217;s bombshell testimony. Affirmation that Paul Ryan is on tape discussing Wikileaks and Russian money laundering with Sergei Kislyak at the GOP convention &#8211; as well as the extensive further tapes that exist of the Washington Post discussion where Ryan admits knowledge of the conspiracy to wash Russian money &#8211; may have been passed on in detail in order to remind the Speaker that if Russia holds kompromat on him so does the United States, and he may wish to reconsider his position before constantly defending treason by Donald Trump.</p>

	<p>Exclusive: Sources familiar with James Comey&#8217;s thinking say that today&#8217;s explosive testimony was planned in advance as part of the counterintelligence operation against Russia&#8217;s attack on the United States.</p>
<p>James Comey knew in advance he was going to be fired, these sources say, when Trump threatened him. At that point, the Director set in place countermeasures to protect the FBI&#8221;s investigation from Trump&#8217;s interference.</p>
<p>These included discussions with future key players at the Department of Justice and the FBI, these sources say, including Acting Director McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.</p>
<p>It was further anticipated by Director Comey, these sources say, that the Trump team would both try to access FBI data and pass it to Russian intelligence. As we earlier reported exclusively, data from Director Comey&#8217;s computer was both taken by the Trump Team and passed to the Russians. The property of the United States was then recovered, these sources say. Separate sources with links to the Justice Department say, without being definitive, that it is thought that Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered an IT &#8216;audit&#8217; of Director Comey&#8217;s electronics, and so the data may have been lawfully collected in a way that would not raise suspicions. Removable media containing data from Director Comey&#8217;s computer was then passed to the Russians, sources with links to the intelligence community confirm, adding that the said data has been recovered.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Director Comey anticipated further both that Donald Trump would boast he had tapes on him, and that he, Comey, would be called to Congress to give the sensational testimony he has given today under oath. Comey is highly sensitized to the value of television and the news cycle, sources familiar with his thinking say. He had reluctantly become so, after understanding the crucial role the data laundering of Donald Trump played in the election. Comey therefore decided to wait until his live televised hearing to reveal some of his knowledge about the Russian hacking investigation to the public in order that its impact not be diminished. Indeed, with partisans of both parties seeking to blame Comey for their failures, the Director had become convinced that if he were not dismissed the investigation might focus too much on him and not enough on the foreign and domestic enemies of the United States. While he was angered at the manner of his firing, sources report, Director Comey regarded the situation with the dispassionate eye of a chess player sacrificing a rook to back his opponent into a corner. Both Donald Trump and his Russian handlers fell into line, up to and including their concentration on lines in yesterday&#8217;s written testimony, which catfished Russian partisans into repeating &#8216;obstruction of justice&#8217; until the concept was firmly affixed in the public&#8217;s mind. This left Comey open to detailing how Trump obstructed justice without using the term, today.</p>
<p>Director Comey was able to tell the public, using the GLOMAR technique, that both Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions are under criminal investigation for treason with Russia, and that both obstructed justice. Such a killer blow could not have been dealt &#8211; at least not so easily &#8211; had Trump and his Russian allies had the good sense to leave Director Comey to do his job.</p>

	<p>James Comey is about to lay the smack down on Donald Trump. But it is important that patriotic Americans have an understanding of what may happen at a select committee hearing &#8211; given the appalling level of misunderstanding of Admiral Rodgers testimony yesterday.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Patribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to <a href="http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch">donate</a>, there are buttons around the site, or you could <a href="http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch">make a contribution here. </a></strong></p></blockquote>
<h1>Obstruction of Justice &#8211; Reality</h1>
<p>James Comey has clearly described obstruction of justice. He has described in terms Trump asking him to back off the Flynn investigation and demanding loyalty.</p>
<h3>Obstruction of Justice &#8211; Trump Spin</h3>
<p>James Comey doesnt say &#8220;obstruction of justice&#8221; so it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>In the hearing, do not expect James Comey to say &#8216;obstruction of justice&#8217; happened. That is a judgement call.</p>
<h1>Is Trump Under Investigation &#8211; Reality</h1>
<p>Comey&#8217;s testimony letter shifts tenses. It states that at first Trump was not under investigation. However it also clearly says that Comey fully anticipated that this might change, and warned Trump against it. The shifting tenses of the past in the later parts of the memo imply that Trump was under investigation by the time he was dismissed.</p>
<h3>Is Trump Under Investigation &#8211; Trump Spin</h3>
<p>The Trump camp is trying to lie and spin that Comey early on saying that Trump himself was not under investigation at the start of his interactions means that he is not being investigated now, or that he will not be. This is a plain lie.</p>
<p>In the hearing, do not expect Director Comey to breach any classified protocols which would include stating that Trump is under investigation.</p>
<h1>Did Admiral Rogers Excuse Trump &#8211; Reality</h1>
<p>Hell no, he did not. He GLOMARed a message on National Security. Rogers is NSA &#8211; like Coats, his function is NATIONAL SECURITY.  Trump could not have &#8220;obstructed justice&#8221; by leaning on Rogers, but would have interfered with a national security investigation. This matter is, itself, a matter of National Security.</p>
<p>ONLY the FBI has a twin intelligence and law enforcement function. Obstruction of justice is inherent in Trump&#8217;s intervention with James Comey only.</p>
<h3>Did Admiral Rogers Excuse Trump &#8211; Trump Spin</h3>
<p>Trumpers were stupid enough to think that Rogers covered for Trump. He went silent on him like a submarine slipping behind the baffles of its quarry. As senior NSA John Schindler wrote in an exclusive, Rogers has issued an unprecedented &#8216;preserve evidence&#8217; order and has held town halls at the NSA describing election hacking.</p>
<p>James Comey is, as I wrote in January, America&#8217;s white knight. He is a master chess player. He is not interested in Twitter plaudits. He will not give away anything on an ongoing criminal and national security investigation. He will describe facts &#8211; HOW Trump obstructed justice &#8211; and not make characterizations &#8211; &#8220;Trump obstructed justice&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nothing can stop the impeachment of Donald Trump that is presently ongoing. Comey is here today to stop the lies of Trump and his White House flunkies.</p>
