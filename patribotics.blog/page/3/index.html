<p><strong>UPDATED: Boris Epshteyn has denied some parts of this story, which I report within the text. </strong></p>
<p>Sources with links to the intelligence community say it is believed that Carter Page went to Moscow in early July carrying with him a pre-recorded tape of Donald Trump offering to change American policy if he were to be elected, to make it more favorable to Putin. In exchange, Page was authorized directly by Trump to request the help of the Russian government in hacking the election.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/">November 7th I reported </a>that the FBI had been granted a FISA warrant to investigate the activities of two Russian banks, Alfa Bank and Silicoln Valley Bank. I also reported that an earlier attempt to obtain a FISA warrant, in June, had failed in the court because it named Donald Trump himself and three of his associates. In an exclusive at Patribotics, I reported that these named associates were Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and Boris Epshteyn.</p>
<p>Sources close to the intelligence community now report that this application was made because a recording exists of all three men discussing the possibility of Page taking the tape of Trump to Moscow as an earnest of good faith. (Update: Mr. Epshteyn has denied he is on any such recording, but I am not sure if he is denying the conversation took place and have asked his lawyers to clarify). There is a minor dispute over whether Trump himself is also on that tape, as well as the tape that was delivered to Moscow by Carter Page of Trump making this promise. A separate source with links to the intelligence community reported to me several months ago that Boris Epshteyn, alone of the four men named in the first FISA application, is an actual FSB agent (he has strenuously denied this). Paul Manafort is registering as an agent of a foreign power [update: he has yet to do so]; Carter Page has admitted, from public reporting, to have met with Russian intelligence agents.</p>
<p>It may therefore be surmised that Page, Manafort and Epshteyn, in this conversation wherein they discussed taking the Trump tape to Moscow, were all acting in concert as agents of the Russian state first and foremost, and Trump staffers second. Because the provision of such a tape to Putin would clearly be the ultimate in <em>kompromat </em>on a future American President (far worse than any sexual blackmail tape).</p>
<p>The FISC judge, as I reported, rejected that application, made in June. Director Comey likely proved to the satisfaction of the court that Page, Manafort and Epshteyn were acting as Russian agents. But he may have felt that Trump, by now the nominee, was just a very stupid patsy. And the planned trip had not taken place.</p>
<p>Director Comey redrew this request and presented FISC with a new warrant application. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-obtained-fisa-warrant-to-monitor-former-trump-adviser-carter-page/2017/04/11/620192ea-1e0e-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html?utm_term=.8762eb804e86">Washington Post says that there is a FISA warrant on Page</a>, but it does not say that there is NOT a FISA warrant on the other two men named in the June application. I will therefore assume from now on that the July FISA warrant granted targets Page, Manafort and Epshteyn.</p>
<p>Page had always seemed weirdly confident about his relationship with Trump. He had the tape of Mr. Trump offering to change policy. Sources say that this tape was played in meetings with Russian intelligence officers in Moscow, and that several Western intelligence sources have recordings of the meetings and the tape which they supplied to US intelligence.</p>
<p>The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-obtained-fisa-warrant-to-monitor-former-trump-adviser-carter-page/2017/04/11/620192ea-1e0e-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html?utm_term=.8762eb804e86">does not name the date in July</a> when Director Comey obtained his warrant. It seems likely however that it would not have been before July 5-8, when Page was in Russia. Furthermore, my own story on the separate FISA warrant granted on the two Russian banks states that Director Comey specifically sought permission to examine existing transcripts and intercepts on US persons as they related to this inquiry into money laundering into the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>My November 7th report directly connects the granting of the banking warrant to election hacking of the DNC. It is fair to say that, at the time of writing, I did not understand precisely how these two matters were connected. I now know and have reported that the server was washing databases of DNC hacked materials with voter registration materials. It is clear that, if my sources were correct, Director Comey would not have been able to listen to the recording of Mr. Trump played by Mr. Page in the offices of Russian intelligence in Moscow until he obtained that warrant, in October; his July warrant on Page came too late to affect a trip on July 5-7th.</p>
<p>When Carter Page returned to the RNC in Cleveland, he and Jeff Sessions, who recruited him to Team Trump via the Alfa Bank lobbyist Richard Burt, both met with the Russian spymaster Sergei Kislyak. From public reporting, we know that they not only changed the RNC platform on Ukraine at the behest of Russia, but also discussed lifting sanctions, a violation of the Logan Act.</p>
<p>Mr. Epshteyn was probably also present at that meeting. [Update &#8211; Mr. Epshteyn has issued a denial that he is an FSB agent, and has denied &#8220;meeting with Russian spymaster&#8221; Sergei Kislyak, as I have described the Ambassador. It is unclear to me from the wording of the letter whether he is denying that he ever met with Mr. Kislyak, or that Mr. Kislyak is a spymaster; I am seeking clarification]. The reason I say this is that I can personally report that Mr. Epshteyn, whom I had met several times in the green room at Fox News, and I, had a bet on &#8211; I bet him $100 that the Republican Party would not actually nominate the racist and sexist Donald Trump.</p>
<p>I lost that bet and made a point of texting Mr. Epshteyn at the conference to pay up. He was charming. I handed over the $100. He went back to Mr. Trump&#8217;s private suite.</p>
<p>I now realize that I was probably giving money directly to an agent of Russia (at Mr. Epshteyn&#8217;s request, I have changed this from &#8220;an FSB agent&#8221;. Mr. Epshteyn has not yet  clarified for me if he is an agent of Russia under FARA, so I am altering the text pending his answer). But if I could not hear what Mr. Page, Mr. Manafort, and Mr. Kislyak were discussing with the Russian Ambassador behind the door of Donald Trump&#8217;s suite, the FBI most certainly could.</p>
<p>I will produce a short timeline of the Trump-Russia story on this blog tomorrow. For now, the point is that intelligence sources say that Page, Manafort and Epshteyn, possibly also with Trump, are on tape discussing how Page should carry a recording of Donald Trump to Moscow, offering his bona fides in exchange for Russia&#8217;s help hacking the election (something that Epshteyn denies, specifically, he denies that he is on tape doing so &#8211; I have sought clarification as to whether the conversation happened, and will amend the text when I receive an answer); and that the said tape of Trump was played by Page to Russian intelligence, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/u-s-intel-officials-probe-ties-between-trump-adviser-and-kremlin-175046002.html">possibly including Mr. Diveykin, the Russian official in charge of hacking the election</a>; and that multiple foreign intelligence services, among them the UK, Germany and Ukraine, have a tape of this; and that finally, in October, the FBI was able to listen to that tape.</p>
<p>So God bless America, and God Save the Queen.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
	<p>Sources linked to the intelligence community say that General Mike Flynn’s trips to Cambridge and across Europe will form a key part of Donald Trump&#8217;s impeachment and the prosecutions of dozens of his associates.</p>
<p>According to several sources within the intelligence community, Michael Flynn was co-ordinating, with and for Russian agents, the drafting of messages that Vladimir Putin was using to attack democracy in not only the United States, but across Europe. Furthermore, Flynn was doing this with the full knowledge of the Trump campaign, including Donald Trump himself.</p>
<p>This news directly relates to the data laundering performed by the Alfa Bank server on behalf of Donald Trump and Russia, where, as I reported, the <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/04/04/putins-hacker-wikileaks-host-pyotr-chayanov-hacked-americas-vote-system-and-the-dnc/">Trump campaign colluded with the hacking of both the DNC and state voter databases</a>.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/04/01/alfa-bank-trump-tower-and-a-social-media-impeachment/"> Alfa Bank server &#8216;washed&#8217; that data together to tell Trump where to target it</a>, sources say. But the messages and content <em>with which </em>targets were served was co-ordinated with Russia by General Flynn.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Flynn took the same hacking tools and artificial intelligence coded in Russia and <a href="https://heatst.com/world/how-russias-twitter-bots-and-trolls-work-with-donald-trump-campaign-accounts/">helped far-right and Nazi parties across Europe use it in their own nations</a>. Intelligence sources assert that multiple NATO partners have evidence of this and that it has been provided to the FBI.</p>
<p>If &#8216;data laundering&#8217; is the first part of the Trump Russia incontrovertible evidence, &#8216;propaganda targeting&#8217; is the second part. Flynn attacked not only the United States but all her Western allies on Russia&#8217;s behalf, with the full knowledge and connivance of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Both halves of the social media impeachment will, sources assert, be key to Director Comey&#8217;s overall case. This is the &#8216;incontrovertible evidence&#8217; to which Sir Richard Dearlove and others have referred.</p>
<h2>Explaining Data Laundering and Fake News</h2>
<p>The broad case of Russia’s hacking the US election can be divided into two relatively simple spheres. There is another branch of the criminal investigation that focuses on money-laundering and corrupt payments from Russia and Russian satellites to Mr. Trump and to his allies. But the actual <i>hacking </i>of the US election follows a relatively simple narrative line in two halves; hacking and targeting. Mr. Flynn’s activities spanned the two and link them to Russian active measures all across Europe, including the current attack on the French election.</p>
<p>As I previously reported in an exclusive story on this blog, the Trump server at Cendyn was communicating to Alfa Bank in Russia hacked data from state voter databases and the DNC’s own voter targeting engine, Vertica. The precise combination of these two databases allowed Cambridge Analytica and SCL both to create Russian-directed propaganda and target it at voting groups with extraordinary precision. Intelligence sources now tell me that SVB bank, the second bank named in the FISA warrant I exclusively reported on Nov 7<sup>th</sup>, was also involved in messaging Alfa Bank. There will be further explanation of that in another post.</p>
<p>The technology behind Cambridge Analytica’s targeting was stolen from Facebook by Alexander Kogan, who has <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win">gone to Singapore and renamed himself Alex Spectre</a>. In many ways, the Trump-Russia story begins and ends at Cambridge University. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ee2ccde2-c775-11e6-9043-7e34c07b46ef">Dimtry Firtash, the corrupt Russian oligarch who is Paul Manafort’s patron</a>, gave <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/wanted-oligarch-donated-6m-to-cambridge-3dqnpcmzl">Cambridge £6 million pounds </a> <a href="http://thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2017/02/22/billionaire-benefactor-cambridge-university-faces-threat-extradition-us-89704">since 2010</a>. With that money evidently came a large ring of Russian spies, probably including Kogan.</p>
<p>Fake news in the 2016 election was not, in fact, fake news. <a href="https://heatst.com/world/how-russias-twitter-bots-and-trolls-work-with-donald-trump-campaign-accounts/">It was real propaganda, coordinated and paid for by the Russian state.</a> General Flynn was actively involved on Russia’s behalf, sources say, with discussing how this propaganda could be used and targeted across Europe and elsewhere, as well as in Donald Trump’s campaign.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Dearlove, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d43cd586-c396-11e6-9bca-2b93a6856354">the former head of MI6, told the Financial Times </a>that he and other British former spies had left a dining club at Cambridge &#8211; a club to which Flynn belonged &#8211; because of concerns about Russian intelligence penetrating it. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d43cd586-c396-11e6-9bca-2b93a6856354">General Flynn had been a regular attendee</a>, the story said. It added that British intelligence was extremely concerned about some ‘startups’ in Cambridge being <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d43cd586-c396-11e6-9bca-2b93a6856354">Russian intelligence, notably Veruscript.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Sir Richard and his colleagues suspect that Veruscript — a newly established digital publishing house that has provided funding to set up a new journal of intelligence and to cover some of the seminar’s costs — may be acting as a front for the Russian intelligence services</p></blockquote>
<p>The story did not get much attention in the America MSM, but I recognise the worthy papers an intelligence veteran in the UK might use to front-face something for reporters. (If Sir Richard is reading this report I do hope he will consider giving it to me next time. I could have told him firewalls = death for dissemination).</p>
<p>The Guardian followed this up with a story about<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/31/michael-flynn-new-evidence-spy-chiefs-had-concerns-about-russian-ties"> a probable woman FSB agent or asset at Cambridge,</a> to whom General Flynn, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/31/michael-flynn-new-evidence-spy-chiefs-had-concerns-about-russian-ties">who is as vain as he is stupid,</a> had signed billets-doux marked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/31/michael-flynn-new-evidence-spy-chiefs-had-concerns-about-russian-ties">“General Misha”, the Russian word for Mike</a>.</p>
<p>In Cambridge, intelligence sources say, Flynn was meeting with not only those who had coded the technology but Russian spies talking about the propaganda it should distribute.</p>
<p>However, Flynn did not stop there. With the full knowledge of both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, “General Misha” continued his Nazi &#8220;tour of Europe&#8221;, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/michael-flynn-putin-trump-austria-far-right-2016-12">with meetings both in Europe and of the EU far right at Trump Tower</a>, discussing how the Russian propaganda of SCL could be targeted <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/trumps-ambassador-europe-far-right-news-lombardi/">directly in their countries in order to swing their elections</a>. Notably, Flynn was caught with the head of the far-right party in Austria. This man was  then invited by Donald Trump to the inauguration. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/19/nigel-farage-trump-inauguration-far-right">Other far-right Russian allies invited to the inauguration,</a> or who came to meet Trump Russia associates at Trump tower, and who were assisted by the Russian botnet and Russian propaganda, include <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38600560">Marine Le Pen</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/19/nigel-farage-trump-inauguration-far-right">Nigel Farage.</a></p>
<p>Sir Richard and US sources have indicated to the Guardian newspaper that Director Comey has direct and incontrovertible evidence that Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia. This relates to the FISA warrant that I reported on November 7<sup>th</sup> and my April 1<sup>st</sup> report (which I had previously published as a theory) that the AlfaBank server was laundering two hacked databases together for targeting &#8211; the DNC’s own and the voter registration databases. However, the other parts of that evidence, I can report today, involve General Flynn’s discussions with Russian spies and the EU far-right on how they could use similar technology to hack and target Russian active measures in their own country.</p>
<p>In this scenario, it is easy to see that “Honest Misha” Flynn thought of himself as the leading commander for Russia’s attack on the West.</p>

What that means in layman terms is that the Russian dictator can now see the IP addresses of anybody reading Wikileaks, (helpful with targeting propaganda at them, as he sees what stories they are reading), and also the IP addresses used now or in the past by any donors to Wikileaks &#8211; of money or leaks. <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/14/wikileaks-hands-keys-to-putins-russian-hacker-readers-leakers-tracked/">That means Putin can blackmail whistleblowers from the US military and elsewhere into becoming his spies. </a></p>
<p><strong>I further reported, based on intelligence sources that it was <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/04/04/putins-hacker-wikileaks-host-pyotr-chayanov-hacked-americas-vote-system-and-the-dnc/">Chayanov’s company Hostkey that US intelligence determined hacked the state voter databases </a>(named in their October 7<sup>th</sup> statement as ‘a Russian company’).</strong> Because the USIC named Wikileaks as a Russian government actor in that same statement, and because Chayanov holds Wikileaks SSL keys and servers, USIC now knows, if it did not before, that the Russian government hacked the state voter databases. The motherlode of the DNC leaks was not the DNC emails Wikileaks released; rather, it was the Vertica database that the DNC used and which had files on the voting behavior of all listed voters (hence the BernieBros that disappeared from Twitter &#8211; they were designed to suppress the Clinton vote). The Steele Dossier, which sources say is true in all important respects, states that Russian moles in the DNC leaked the files to Russia &#8211; they were as much hackers as Snowden was at the USA. Because there are too many states to place leakers in, Chayanov was forced actually to <i>hack</i> the state voter registration databases.</p>
<p>The Trump server was washing these two databases together for targeting by the campaign as I exclusively reported, with <a href="https://teapainusa.wordpress.com/2017/04/03/data-patterns-suggest-trump-towerspectrum-health-ran-a-stealth-data-machine-with-russia/">further exclusive reporting on the precise method by TeaPainUSA, here.</a></p>
<p>Next, with the accurate data provided by the data laundering, the Trump campaign needed to target voting groups with accuracy. It did this by creating fake news and ugly memes, and receiving these from Russian sources. Agents of influence of Russia used to propel these fake stories and memes included Sputnik, Jack Posobiec, and the “botnet” created by Microchip, who is a composite persona. Microchip are Russian agents of influence, and began to create the pro-Trump troll net in 2015, according to Buzzfeed. As well as actual bots based on keywords, the Microchip Russian botnet used human beings and particular hashtags to push the AI themed messaging. Trump’s campaign created fake news to order. Flynn’s twitter account, and that of his son, were lambasted for publishing fake news, but in point of fact it is easy &#8211; and provable &#8211; to see that the Microchip botnet of Russia was tweeting from the account. Flynn’s twitter used the same exact hashtags and linked back to the MagaX3 PAC. He also pushed out the Wikileaks releases of the stolen DNC material (now declared by the CIA to be Russian active measures) with hashtags like #PodestaEmails19 as they arose (remember, anybody clicking on these links had now given their IP address to Putin).</p>
<p>Flynn was working in Trump Tower with<a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/trumps-ambassador-europe-far-right-news-lombardi/"><strong> &#8216;Chief Facebook Officer&#8217; Guido Lombardi,</strong> </a>profile in Politico EU, using their mutual hatred of Islam as a wedge issue.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lombardi, who describes himself as a real estate investor with rightward political leanings, said that throughout the presidential campaign he fielded calls from representatives of a veritable Who’s Who of the European Right, including French far-right leader Marine Le Pen<b> </b>— who was spotted in Trump Tower Thursday — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, members of Austria’s Freedom Party, as well as the center-right French Républicains party who all wanted to meet with Trump.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Lombardi’s main role, he said, was to run an unofficial, guerilla-style social media operation that aimed to amplify the candidate’s message online. At its height, Lombardi said the operation included sites and Facebook pages for many niche groups of Trump supporters such as  “<a href="http://www.bikersfortrump2016.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bikers for Trump</a>,” “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LatinosandHispanicsforDonaldTrump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latinos for Trump</a>” and “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Vets4trump16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veterans for Trump</a>.”</p>
<p>“In June of 2015, I told Donald, ‘I’d love to help,&#8217;” said Lombardi. “‘But I can’t work directly for the campaign because I have all kinds of rules and regulations. I will take care of unofficial media. I will take care of students. I will take care of bikers. I will take care of all the crazies … There is no official connection so [no] liability.’ He said, ‘Great.&#8217;”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By the end of the campaign, Lombardi said he was curating some 500 online groups that were run by a network of volunteers. He said he had started some of them but did not specify how many.</span></p>
<p>It was not possible to verify this claim or Lombardi’s link to the websites. Several of the groups cited by Lombardi had garnered more than 100,000 “likes” on Facebook and featured pro-Trump memes and stories from little-known news sources.</p></blockquote>
<p>Below, the screenshot shows Flynn pushing out this Russian co-ordinated propaganda targeted by Lombardi.</p>
<p><a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2016/11/18/politics/will-trump-really-purge-obamas-generals/">Lombardi, Flynn and Gaffney, along with Devin Nunes, were in the Transition Team</a> and were willing to slam US intelligence and military leaders.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fueling concerns are reports of Trump’s selection of former Defense Intelligence Agency director<strong> Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn</strong> as n<strong>ational security adviser.</strong> Flynn was purged himself in 2014 by his superiors in the military intelligence community&#8230;.Another Trump transition leader who has <strong>sharp criticisms of current military and intelligence leaders</strong> regarding the war on terrorism is House Intelligence Chairman <strong>Devin Nunes, R-Calif.</strong>&#8230;<strong> Nunes is now one of the three Trump transition officials in charge of national security appointments</strong>, along with former congressman Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., and <strong>Reagan-era official Frank Gaffney,</strong></p>

<p>A story that <a href="https://heatst.com/world/how-russias-twitter-bots-and-trolls-work-with-donald-trump-campaign-accounts/">I myself reported for Heat Street in October, 2016</a> &#8211; before I reported the FISA warrant on Alfa Bank and SVB Bank &#8211; that concerned Trump’s bots and trolls actually pointed to a lot of what is reported here. Because I did note in that story that the Russian botnet AI had spread far beyond America and existed in multiple languages.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Coda: Finding A Common Message Pushed Out by Both Types of Putinbot</strong></p>
<p>One easy way to spot a Russian troll, whether curated or automated, is to look for them pushing out the identical message. Do we remember that “Putin: How Obama Created ISIS” video?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Putin%20Tells%20Everyone%20Exactly%20Who%20Created%20ISIS&amp;src=typd">This happens (see link)</a>. Please note the “various” “diverse” profiles Russian men are adopting here.  We have an Hispanic woman, a Muslim woman, a white far left Bernie Sanders supporter, and a patriotic redneck.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>but wait! There’s more! By using this method we can see how the Russian troll farm places its fictional accounts around the world and in multiple languages. Australia, Germany, Japan, Africa…</p>
<p>Dutch, from a Holland-based account&#8230;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-error">
<p dir="ltr" lang="nl">Putin legt glashelder uit wie uiteindelijk ISIS gecreëerd heeft!! Putin Tells Everyone Exactly Who Created ISIS <a href="https://t.co/1o5lxfZwA9">https://t.co/1o5lxfZwA9</a></p>
<p>— JW van den Born (@janwillemvdborn) <a href="https://twitter.com/janwillemvdborn/status/764103635999551488">August 12, 2016</a></p>
<p>Spanish, French and German&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I further pointed out that all these countries had certain tropes in common. Support for Trump, Brexit, Viktor Orban, and Nigel Farage as well as Marine Le Pen.</p>
<blockquote><p>The interesting thing about analyzing Mom For Trump is his use of most of the tropes pushed by Breitbart’s Steven Bannon, now a Trump advisor. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trump</li>
<li>Putin</li>
<li>Russia</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/StacyBrewer18/status/746192865961746432">Brexit</a></li>
<li>Nigel Farage</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of the “EU located” Putinbots will also hawk <strong>the Russian puppet Viktor Orban</strong>, the PM of Hungary. Here’s a Spanish-language Putinbot who has chucked in an avatar boosting Assad for good measure (his account reads “the tiger of damascus”).</p></blockquote>
<p>It now turns out that on his trips to Cambridge and through the EU, General Misha Flynn was specifically co-ordinating Russian propaganda for the far right.</p>
<p>The Alfa Bank server’s washing of the voter registration and Vertica databases is one half of the incontrovertible evidence that will see Donald Trump impeached. But Moscow Mike Flynn’s Treason Tour of Europe is the other half of it. Flynn is the key not only to Vladimir Putin’s attack on America, but also to his attack on the entire Western World.</p>
<p>An attack in which Donald J Trump was fully and totally complicit.</p>

<p>TL/DR: <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NH9QO8L5BL0J:https://ipinfo.io/AS57043+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">Server King, Hostkey, and Mir Telemakti are one and the same </a>&#8211; fronts for the Russian govt.</p>
<p>On October 7th the DHS and the Intelligence Community released <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement">a statement on Russian hacking of the election</a>.</p>
<p>They stated that:</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that <strong>the Russian Government</strong> directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.<strong> The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.</strong> These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. <strong>We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia&#8217;s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Let us translate: the USIC confirms that Guccifer 2 hacked the DNC emails and was directed by Vladimir Putin to do so.</p>
<p>Next, we move on to state voter registration databases:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which <strong>in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company.</strong> However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, happily, I believe I am in a position to do so. Because I can report that sources say that the Russian company which hacked voter registration databases was Hostkey &#8211; the host of Wikileaks.<a href="https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/861353600756436992"> King Servers is in fact </a><em><a href="https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/861353600756436992">the same</a> </em>Russian front as Hostkey &#8211; <strong><a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NH9QO8L5BL0J:https://ipinfo.io/AS57043+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">both ultimately resolving to, and owned by, the Russian state&#8217;s Mir Telemakti.</a></strong></p>

<p>Regular readers of Patribotics will note that we broke two big stories featuring Hostkey, and its owner, a Russian hacker and troll called Pyotr Chayanov.</p>
<p>The first is that <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/12/wikileaks-is-connected-to-russia-despite-their-claimswikileaks-is-connected-to-russia-despite-their-claims/">Wikileaks, one week before their release of the DNC hack emails, acquired two servers in Russia</a> on which to store all their data. The owner of these massive servers was the hacker Pyotr (Peter) Chayanov, head of Hostkey.</p>
<p>Upon our publishing <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/12/wikileaks-is-connected-to-russia-despite-their-claimswikileaks-is-connected-to-russia-despite-their-claims/">that epic exclusive by Laurelai Bailey</a>, @Stuxnetsource on Twitter, Mr. Chayanov deleted his entire account, but not before I screenshot all of it.</p>
<p>The second story, even more grave than the first, was that Wikileaks had not merely bought or acquired Russian servers, <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/14/wikileaks-hands-keys-to-putins-russian-hacker-readers-leakers-tracked/">they had given Chayanov and Hostkey their SSL keys.</a> That in turn meant that Vladimir Putin, Chayanov&#8217;s boss, <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/14/wikileaks-hands-keys-to-putins-russian-hacker-readers-leakers-tracked/">can see the IP of everybody reading anything on Wikileaks</a> and indeed, can see the IP address of anybody who ever donated to Wikileaks.</p>
<p>But because Laurelai discovered that Hostkey/Chayanov had the Wikileaks servers, she inadvertently also proved that it was Russia who hacked US voter databases.</p>
<p>Because it is the same company and the same server.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/04/01/alfa-bank-trump-tower-and-a-social-media-impeachment/">our most recent exclusive story reported that intelligence sources say the Alfa Bank server was passing voter database info to and from the Russian state</a>, and then handing this <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/04/01/alfa-bank-trump-tower-and-a-social-media-impeachment/">info to SCL and Cambridge Analytica (ultimately owned by Alfa Bank) for targeting by the Trump campaign with propaganda</a>.</p>
<p>The DNC hack, hosted by Hostkey and Chayanov, would <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/29/politics/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee-hacked/index.html">have had access to Vertica, the DNC&#8217;s voter registration server</a>. This server had <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/29/politics/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee-hacked/index.html">all the DNC&#8217;s information on all their voters and where they lived, voting records and so forth</a>. Vertica had the DNC&#8217;s voter addresses, campaign modeling and so forth. It was the goldmine. It was everything.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;An <strong>analytics data program</strong> maintained by the DNC, and used by our campaign and a number of other entities, was accessed as part of the DNC hack,&#8221; said Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is abundantly clear then that Mr. Chayanov&#8217;s Hostkey hackers are Guccifer2; that since Hostkey published the Wikileaks stuff and also hacked US voter state databases, the Alfa server was probably comparing the state rolls with the DNC information; and that this was passed back to the Trump campaign through the Trump server.</p>
<p>If the USIC is confident that Guccifer2 was directed by Russia and Putin, then they now know state database hacking was also directed by him, for Hostkey is the same exact company that performed both attacks and then hosted the results.</p>
<p>Some sources report that there was also &#8220;IP targeting&#8221;  for the &#8220;dark Facebook posts&#8221; shown on users&#8217; feeds (they used VPNs, and saw messages relevant to those VPNs). That could have come about because <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/14/wikileaks-hands-keys-to-putins-russian-hacker-readers-leakers-tracked/">anybody who read anything on Wikileaks had now handed over their IP address to Vladimir Putin</a>, because his agent, Julian Assange, had <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/14/wikileaks-hands-keys-to-putins-russian-hacker-readers-leakers-tracked/">given Chayanov the Wikileaks SSL keys</a>.</p>
<p>A future post will look at just how SCL (owned ultimately by Alfa Bank) created dark posts to target to Democratic voters and how this is tied right back to Trump.</p>
<p>And, ladies and gentlemen, that is the story of how Russian hackers Hostkey, working for Vladimir Putin, in partnership with Donald Trump and his team of traitors, attacked a US election and helped Donald Trump cheat his way into America&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>Was it good for you?</p>

	<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Sources with links to the intelligence community have now confirmed that this theory is accurate, and I am therefore upgrading this story from my theory to a factual report.</p>
<h4><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="https://patribotics.blog">Patribotics</a> </strong></span>hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers.

<p>Once I announced on Twitter and elsewhere that this theory was validated by sources, data scientists who had been examining the server data began to re-examine it in the light of this statement.<a href="https://twitter.com/TeaPainUSA"> @TeaPainUSA</a> on Twitter, who knows his data science, collaborated with some other <a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0">patriot data scientists on Twitter</a> and off to produce<a href="https://teapainusa.wordpress.com/2017/04/03/data-patterns-suggest-trump-towerspectrum-health-ran-a-stealth-data-machine-with-russia/"> this crucial report</a> explaining <a href="https://teapainusa.wordpress.com/2017/04/03/data-patterns-suggest-trump-towerspectrum-health-ran-a-stealth-data-machine-with-russia/"><em>how </em>Alfa&#8217;s server laundered</a> the data.</p>
<p>Original:</p>
<p>Here is my theory of how Donald Trump will be impeached, and scores of people around him jailed.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just money laundering &#8211; it was &#8220;data laundering&#8221;.</p>
<p>My theory is based on public reporting, to which I will link in the text. Here it is:</p>
<p>Alfa Bank is a front for Russian intelligence. Along with Dimitry Firtash, a Russian agent of influence, it owns Cambridge Analytica, the data targeting company used by Trump&#8217;s campaign. It also owns SCL, the propaganda company responsible for what has been termed &#8220;fake news&#8221; but was actually real propaganda co-ordinated by Russian intelligence.</p>
<p>Cambridge Analytica and SCL use Facebook data they had no right to acquire, illegally stolen by a Russian spy working at Cambridge, to build an unbeatable target database of propaganda.</p>
<p>In the closing days of the election, the Russian state hacked into the voter rolls of the United States. Russian intelligence did this in order that they could provide this information to Alfa Bank in order to use Cambridge Analytica&#8217;s targeting, and SCL&#8217;s propaganda, in order precisely to target voters and tip them to Trump.</p>

<p>Paul Manafort, who had always worked for and with the Trump campaign and who never left the campaign, relayed messages to Trump based on this stolen voter database information married to Cambridge Analytica and SCL targeting.</p>
<p><strong>Both Manafort and Trump knew that this targeting information was based on stolen voter databases. </strong></p>
<p>The Alfa Bank server in Trump Tower provided fresh evidence for the granting of the FISA warrant, I reported. (this is a fact). However, the warrant was broader than merely looking at the server metadata. It explicitly covered US persons caught up in the inquiry and explicitly covered the right for the FBI to read intercepts and hear tapes and other materials on US persons, related to this inquiry, already existing and provided by intelligence from a Baltic state ally, which report was Estonia. [Editor &#8211; this is a correction from my earlier wrong report of Lithuania].</p>
<p>I believe the Alfa Bank server was sending back to Russia information on the hacked voter databases and how they could be micro-targeted.</p>
<p>Just before the election, Manafort, who worked with Firtash and Alfa Bank, told Trump to go and campaign in Michigan. Public polling showed that Trump had no chance in Michigan.</p>
<p>I believe, in summary:</p>
<p>A Russian spy stole the Facebook data of hundreds of millions of Americans</p>
<p>From that data, Russia crafted propaganda messages via SCL and targeted them by Cambridge Analytica</p>
<p>Both of these were owned by Alfa Bank and Firtash, Russian agent and boss of Manafort;</p>
<p>In order to perfect the social media targeting Russia hacked the electoral voter databases of various key American states:</p>
<p>This information was fed back to Manafort and Cambridge Analytica / SCL via the means of the bank server in Trump Tower;</p>
<p>Manafort and Trump used terrifyingly accurate micro-targeting obtained firstly by Facebook theft but secondly by Russia obtaining the exact demographic profiles of voters through hacks of US state databases and passing it back to Cambridge Analytica.</p>
<p>This theory, if true, would directly connect the Russian state with the Trump campaign and mean that Trump colluded with Russian spies who were hacking America. He will be impeached for it.</p>
<p>There is much more Trump has done, but the Russian voter database hacks &#8212;&gt;  to Cambridge Analytica &#8212;&gt; to SCL &#8220;fake news&#8221; to target the election &#8212;-&gt; with Trump&#8217;s knowledge via Manafort &#8211;  is the single most direct proof of Trump&#8217;s collusion with America&#8217;s enemies.</p>
<p>Furthermore and as a coda,</p>
<p>I believe, although to what Chris Steele might call a &#8216;low confidence&#8217; level, that Roger Stone was communicating with Guccifer2 who hacked the DNC and Podesta, and that these releases had not worked. I believe that whoever Stone&#8217;s &#8220;go-between&#8221; to Wikileaks was, that person worked for or with Cambridge Analytica/SCL / Alfa Bank , and that person passed on the message that precise targeting and propaganda would be needed to win the election, hence the hacking of the voter databases and the messaging that went back into them.</p>
<p>I have a pretty strong idea who this person and his backers are, and I shall be passing it to UK intelligence.</p>
<p>Lastly, following our exclusive reporting that Wikileaks is a Russian front who, days before the DNC hack, not only bought Russian servers, but gave their SSL keys to a Russian hacker Peter Chayanov, meaning he could see &#8211; and the FSB could see &#8211; everything on the Wikileaks site, including the IP address of any foolish Americans &#8220;whistleblowing&#8221; to Wikileaks (like Chelsea Manning), meaning Putin could blackmail them, I will assume that Chayanov is Guccifer2; that he was collaborating with Stone and Manafort both directly and indirectly; and that he worked with Russian state hackers to attack US voter databases.</p>
<p>And, to quote Jim Carrey in &#8216;Liar, Liar,&#8217; &#8220;That&#8217;s the game!&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='845' height='506' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9RaAgI7eZMg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I will list the reporting on which this theory is based. I will address &#8220;Moscow Mike Misha Flynn&#8221; and the Cambridge University spy ring in another post &#8211; I have learned the hard way that too much information just shuts people down (when they don&#8217;t have ADHD). But as a snippet, I will say that I believe <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/28/kushner-and-trump-taped-at-secret-trump-tower-meetings-with-russians/">Jared Kushner</a> and Mike Flynn were both caught talking to Russian spies who worked with <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/28/kushner-and-trump-taped-at-secret-trump-tower-meetings-with-russians/">Sberbank, the parent company of SVB Bank &#8211; the OTHER bank that was a named target of the FISA warrant</a>.</p>

<p>So, if you like, <strong>Alfa Bank</strong> &#8211; which owned Cambridge Analytica and passed info to and from Russia on hacked voter databases, for electoral gain, is the <strong>SIGINT</strong> part of this theory (Signals intelligence) &#8211; and<strong> S</strong><strong>VB </strong><strong>Bank</strong><a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/27/boris-epshteyn-named-in-july-fisa-application-did-nunes-obstruct-justice/">, </a>which<a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/27/boris-epshteyn-named-in-july-fisa-application-did-nunes-obstruct-justice/"> funded &#8220;startups&#8221; through Russian intel front Sberbank</a>, is the <strong>HUMINT</strong> part of this theory &#8211; think <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/28/kushner-and-trump-taped-at-secret-trump-tower-meetings-with-russians/">Kushner</a>, Mike Flynn and <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/27/boris-epshteyn-named-in-july-fisa-application-did-nunes-obstruct-justice/">Epshteyn</a>.</p>
<p>Again, <strong>Alfa Bank</strong> and <strong>SVB Bank</strong> are the two <a href="https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/">NAMED TARGETS of the FISA warrant</a> granted <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38589427">on October 15th</a> &#8211; one week after <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national">US intelligence put out a statement on voter database hacking, on October 7th.</a></p>
<p>I believe this is why.  There was money laundering from these banks &#8211; but there was data laundering, too.</p>

	<p>On March 3rd, Donald Trump made a series of tweets. Three were about a wiretap at Trump Tower. Two, however, were about Jeff Sessions meeting the Russian ambassador. Those tweets got lost in the resulting storm.</p>
<p>Over the past week, Devin Nunes obstructed justice on TV, both announcing that one White House staffer was under investigation <em>and</em> that &#8220;a transition team member&#8221; was recorded in a FISA intercept.</p>

<p><a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/27/boris-epshteyn-named-in-july-fisa-application-did-nunes-obstruct-justice/">As we exclusively reported, that staffer was almost certainly Boris Epshteyn</a>, named by Comey in his <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/27/boris-epshteyn-named-in-july-fisa-application-did-nunes-obstruct-justice/">first failed FISA application</a> in June.</p>
<p><a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/27/did-nunes-leak-fisa-warrant-info-via-white-house-lawyer-michael-ellis/">Also as we exclusively reported, Michael Ellis is suspected </a>of having leaked this material to Nunes.</p>
<p>But what would be so bad that it would cause Nunes to rush to the White House <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/27/did-nunes-leak-fisa-warrant-info-via-white-house-lawyer-michael-ellis/">to illegally receive top-secret FISA evidence</a>?</p>
<p>I believe that Jared Kushner is on tape talking to a Russian spy. Worse, I believe that as part of entirely legal and admissible FISA evidence, Donald Trump is also on tape talking to a Russian spy about money laundering.</p>
<p>Here is my reasoning. First,the facts. I reported that two Russian banks, <a href="https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/">SVB Bank </a>and Alfa Bank, were the subjects, the named targets, of the FISA warrant looking at Russian money being laundered into the Trump campaign. This was a world exclusive on November 7th.</p>

<p>Permission was granted for the FBI to look at intercepts that involved US persons as they related to this campaign / money laundering.</p>
<p><a href="https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/">Boris Epshteyn was named in an earlier version of this case to the court</a>, and the warrant was then denied. But it is not a different case; rather, minimization was applied by the FBI before the warrant was granted.</p>
<p>Those are the facts of the matter on the warrant. It is also factually true that Jeff Sessions met with Kislyak, a spy recruiter, and perjured himself over it. It is further factually true that Jared Kushner snuck Kislyak into Trump Tower. Lastly, it is factually true that Jared Kushner met Gorkov, an FSB spy, at the request of Kislyak,</p>
<p>Second, informed speculation.</p>
<p>I believe that on March 3rd, Michael Ellis, newly placed in the White House, gave Donald Trump some very bad news (illegally). First he told him that Kislayak&#8217;s phone calls had been intercepted and his meetings taped &#8211; as is normal. Hence Jeff Sessions&#8217; conversations with the spy-master were on tape. Worse, Ellis told Trump, members of Donald Trump&#8217;s own family had been taped talking to that same Russian ambassador. Lastly, he, Donald Trump, was also recorded &#8211; his phone was recorded &#8211; in Trump Tower &#8211; talking to Kislyak.</p>
<p>Trump would have blustered and demanded to know how this was legal. Ellis would have told him about the FISA warrant. My world exclusive stated this was granted in October, hence Trump&#8217;s squeals that &#8220;Obama&#8221; had him &#8220;tapped&#8221; &#8220;right before the victory&#8221;.</p>
<p>I believe that here Trump referred to the granting of the warrant as described by Ellis. Ellis may have said, for example, that the Justice Department had to authorize the application to FISC. Trump garbled this because he is galactically stupid.</p>
<p>I believe that the references to Trump Tower are because Jared Kushner&#8217;s meeting with Gorkov  and Kislyak was indeed taped because SVB Bank is a direct target of the warrant. Epshteyn led an &#8216;invest in Moscow&#8217; trip in 2014, <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.finanz.ru%2Fnovosti%2Faktsii%2Fsberbank-sozdast-sovmestnoe-predpriyatie-v-oblasti-startapov-s-amerikanskim-Silicon-Valley-Bank-1001290912&amp;anno=2&amp;sandbox=1">Gorkov&#8217;s bank and SVB had signed a memo to &#8220;invest in US startups&#8221;.</a> The latter bit is mentioned in the Steele Dossier.</p>
<p>As a named target, SVB Bank is legitimate &#8211; and US persons caught up in this are legitimate. Jared talking to Gorkov was fair game. <img data-attachment-id="1059" data-permalink="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/28/kushner-and-trump-taped-at-secret-trump-tower-meetings-with-russians/svb/" data-orig-file="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/svb.jpeg" data-orig-size="1166,916" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SVB" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/svb.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/svb.jpeg?w=845" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1059" src="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/svb.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=236" alt="SVB" width="300" height="236" srcset="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/svb.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=236 300w, https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/svb.jpeg?w=600&amp;h=472 600w, https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/svb.jpeg?w=150&amp;h=118 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Kushner had snuck the Russian ambassador secretly into &#8211; Trump Tower. And Trump said &#8220;MY phones were tapped.&#8221; That means &#8211; I believe &#8211; that legal FISA intercepts involve not only Jared Kushner talking to Russian spies but also, because Trump called in to this secret meeting or meetings within Trump Tower, Donald J. Trump.</p>
<p>Michael Ellis probably called Nunes in with urgency because he saw Trump and Kushner named in intercepts. This explains why the equally galactically stupid and treacherous Nunes said that he read top secret FISA evidence &#8216;not to do with Russia&#8217; and &#8216;Russia was never mentioned&#8217;. When you are looking at money-laundering and RICO offenses &#8211; as I report the FISA warrant was &#8211; you do not need to NAME Russia. You discuss dates, amounts of money and deals.</p>
<p>But (at the risk of repeating myself) this was indeed a FISA warrant, and was both a national security and criminal case. It was, as I reported in November, not about common or garden oligarch corruption or the Russian mob &#8211; it was about Russian money being funneled into the Trump campaign, as Paul Wood of the BBC makes clear in his exclusive report of January 12th.</p>
<p>When Ellis saw the actual intercepts involving Trump and Kushner, I postulate, he panicked and rang Nunes for a quiet midnight stroll in the White House grounds &#8211; because Trump needed some way to attack the legal and incidental evidence collected under FISA, and &#8220;fruit of the poisoned tree&#8221; is, quite literally, all these people have left.</p>
<p>But the tree is not poisoned, and the fruit is legally top notch.</p>
<p>How do you like them apples, Mr. Putin?</p>

		</div><!-- .entry-header-column -->

	<div class="entry-content">
	<p>Following our exclusive report that<a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/27/boris-epshteyn-named-in-july-fisa-application-did-nunes-obstruct-justice/"> Devin Nunes leaked information</a> about transition team member, White House staffer and <a href="https://patribotics.blog/2017/03/27/boris-epshteyn-named-in-july-fisa-application-did-nunes-obstruct-justice/">named subject of a failed FISA court application, Boris Epshteyn</a>, I can exclusively report that sources with links to Congress state that staffers working on the Russia investigations believe that lawyers connected to the White House are illegally sharing information with Nunes &#8211; and illegally pressing him to leak it.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Editor’s Note: Donations and Whistleblowing</h4>
<h4>Patribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers. If you would like to <span style="color:#ff6600;"><a style="color:#ff6600;" href="http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch"><strong>donate</strong></a></span>, there are buttons around the site, or you could <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;"><a style="color:#ff6600;" href="http://paypal.me/LouiseMensch">make a contribution here. </a></span> If whistleblowers wish to contact patribotics they are encouraged to get in touch on Twitter, or via the <span style="color:#008000;"><a style="color:#008000;" href="https://patribotics.blog/contact/">contact form elsewhere</a> </span>on this site.</strong></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>While sources are not yet definite as to which lawyer or lawyers they suspect of repeatedly breaking the law on leaks and obstruction of justice, several have named Michael Ellis, of the White House General Counsel&#8217;s office for National Security, as one they suspect.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>Mr. Ellis previous job was the General Counsel for the House Intelligence Committee, working for Mr. Nunes directly. Sources indicate that Nunes recommended Ellis for the White House national security post.</p>
<p>Yesterday it was reported that Nunes&#8217; friend Mr. Ellis, described as his &#8220;close aide&#8221;, only started working for the White House this month, when leaks started.</p>
<p>If indeed Mr. Ellis did pass on information about the FISA evidence on money laundering, possibly involving Epshteyn, to Nunes, asking him to leak it to the press or allowing him to do so, it would be highly illegal conduct.</p>
<p>Mr. Nunes and Mr. Ellis should immediately answer to the rest of the Committee, as to whether anything of the sort occurred, and Mr. Nunes should be hauled before the FBI for the crimes he is committing in plain sight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
	<p>On November 7th,<a href="https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/"> I reported at Heat Street that the FBI had obtained a FISA warrant covering the Trump campaign&#8217;s ties to Russia</a>.</p>
<p>I reported that the FISA warrant had been granted after an earlier, failed application to the court in the summer named Trump and &#8220;at least three other men, who have either formed part of his campaign <a href="https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/">or acted as his media surrogates</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Those names, sources said, were Donald Trump, with Paul Manafort and Carter Page (two men that had formed part of Trump&#8217;s campaign) and Boris Epshteyn, who at the time I reported, the eve of the election itself, had only acted as Mr. Trump&#8217;s media surrogate.</p>
<p>Since that time, Mr. Epshteyn has become a part of government as a Transition Team official and now at the White House and I feel able to be explicit as to the names sources gave me as forming part of the summer application to the court.</p>
<p>It is important to note that <a href="https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/">the application to FISC made by the FBI in July was denied</a>. The FBI must, by definition, have represented to the FISA court that they believed Trump, Page, Manafort and Epshteyn were either actual Russian agents, or Russian &#8220;agents of influence&#8221;, which can be unwitting, as Brad C Moss, a national security lawyer, pointed out in my report for Heat Street.</p>
<p>The application that was successful, in October, named two Russian banks &#8211; rather than US persons suspected by the FBI to be agents of influence for a foreign power &#8211; as it targets- and was drawn more tightly under the &#8216;minimization&#8217; doctrine around money laundering and financial offenses, I reported. <strong>But</strong>, the FISA warrant explicitly granted the FBI permission to examine the communications of U.S. persons as they related to this money laundering inquiry. I did not report any &#8220;wiretapping&#8221; of Trump tower, nor any surveillance; rather, my reporting faithfully reflected the views of my sources that a warrant was granted.</p>
<p>Indeed, rather than any concept of <em>new</em> surveillance, I reported that the FBI had sought permission to examine <em>already existing </em>evidence, provided to the CIA or NSA by allied intelligence services, that related to this inquiry &#8211; specifically, to the money laundering inquiry. They previously had been unable to listen to this evidence, or to read these intercepts, because they involved &#8220;U.S. persons&#8221;. Contrary to the Trump-Bannon bleating about &#8220;deep state&#8221;, sources indicated that Director Comey was most concerned to follow the law very precisely; &#8220;in order that the chain of evidence have a clear basis in a warrant&#8221;, as I said at the time.</p>
<p>Two months later <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38589427">Paul Wood of the BBC published a seminal report on the entire Russian war on American democracy</a>, which included further exclusive details on the FISA warrant, which added to my own reporting and made the picture much clearer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38589427">The existing evidence, he reported</a>, was a tape made by a Baltic state&#8217;s intelligence service, of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38589427">Russian money going into the Trump campaign</a>. It was made in April, and involved a US person or persons. Wood exclusively reported a six-agency task force including the US treasury was set up to investigate this. (He also reported a second failed application to FISC in August, something I did not learn from my sources at the time, but which sources have since confirmed to be accurate). Therefore, &#8216;money laundering&#8217; it may be, but &#8216;from Russia into the Trump campaign&#8217; is the second part of that puzzle, and explains, we may postulate, why Comey described to Congress his national security investigation as including any criminal aspects. It is why the warrant against the Russian banks was sought in a FISC and not an ordinary court. As had I exclusively reported on November 7th, the case was <em>both </em>criminal <em>and </em>a top-level national security case.</p>
<p>Exposing new and unreported evidence in such a case as (I believe) both Trump and Nunes have done is itself a crime.</p>
<p>Wood did not specify, but I believe it to be a fair inference, that one of those US persons was Paul Manafort, who took over the Trump campaign in March, just before the tape was made in April. Carter Page wrote to the FBI demanding they stop investigating him; leaving only Mr. Epshteyn as the unreported name in the failed applications.</p>
<p>I cannot confirm whether Mr. Epshteyn is, as has been speculated about, &#8216;Source E&#8217; in the Steele dossier, but he fits the description given of that source. What I can report is that sources stated Epshteyn was named to the FISA court in July as a target, but &#8211; and I re-emphasize this point &#8211; that application was denied by the court.</p>
<p>Knowing the above, his departure from the White House after two epic failures by Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is not, I believe, a coincidence. Mr. Epshteyn has not been indicted (as far as I know) still less convicted of any crime. But it seems fairly obvious to me that Nunes is obstructing justice in plain sight &#8211;  and should be arrested.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/tommyxtopher/status/843463124560896001">Nunes said</a>:</p>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Huh? Devin Nunes says of &quot;people working at the White House now,&quot; none are under intel investigation or surveillance &quot;but one.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/9lxN79cbgl">pic.twitter.com/9lxN79cbgl</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Tommy Christopher (@tommyxtopher) <a href="https://twitter.com/tommyxtopher/status/843463124560896001">March 19, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>I do not believe that was a slip of the tongue. I believe he referred to Mr. Epshteyn and tipped him off on live television.</p>
<p>Further, Mr. Nunes&#8217; rants about FISA warrants (plural &#8211; I have only reported one, more, clearly, may exist) ought not to be assumed to be fact free. Instead, they should be assumed to be a completely illegal and garbled recitation of classified information illegally acquired and distributed by Nunes. When he says what he read &#8220;did not relate to Russia&#8221; he means he read details of a money-laundering investigation under FISA (but it did relate to Russia). When Nunes says he &#8220;did not hear the word Russia&#8221; nor would he need to if he were illegally reading transcripts of conversations involving money laundering, names and amounts. And when he refers to a member &#8220;of the Presidential transition team&#8221; on which he himself sat, I believe he is referring to Boris Epshteyn.</p>
<p>Mr. Epshteyn has, again, not even been indicted, far less convicted in any court. <a href="https://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/">But IF he is indeed under a top secret investigation </a>and his buddy and Trump lackey Nunes has just discussed both the evidence against him and the fact that he is under investigation, then it is Representative Nunes who needs to be arrested. The House Intelligence Committee should do more than demand that Speaker Ryan remove Devin Nunes as chairman of the Russian hacking inquiry. It should call Nunes as a witness, under oath. Having sat myself on a Select Committee, I know very well that politicians become friends with their opposite numbers. It is hard indeed to turn on a colleague with whom one is friendly. But the Committee must steel themselves to their manifest duty. Removal of Mr. Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee is now a matter of the national security of the United States at the highest level.</p>
