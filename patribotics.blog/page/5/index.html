	<h1><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;"><a style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3727178-U-S-v-Anthony-Weiner-Plea-Agreement.html">Corrected</a> </span>And Updated in Light of Weiner&#8217;s Crime:</span></h1>
<p>It is very important to correct things that are wrong. I have two major corrections to make to my theory, articulated in this story, following<span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3727178-U-S-v-Anthony-Weiner-Plea-Agreement.html"><strong> Anthony Weiner&#8217;s guilty plea</strong></a></span> to one count of <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/united-states-of-america-v-anthony-weiner-court-documents-1.13649048">transferring obscene material to a minor</a> </span>and also of <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>&#8220;<a style="color:#ff0000;" href="http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/united-states-of-america-v-anthony-weiner-court-documents-1.13649048">attempting&#8221; to do so</a>. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>The firs</strong>t</span> is that Weiner did indeed, by his own account and that of prosecutors, transfer sexual material to a minor. The plea deal document said this happened &#8216;in 2016&#8217;. Therefore, all the following must be true, and I was wrong about them: Weiner did sext with a minor; the case was not invented, there was a real crime, with a real girl.</p>
<p>That is a fact. This article was a theory, written as such. And that theory has been proven partly <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/united-states-of-america-v-anthony-weiner-court-documents-1.13649048"><strong>wrong by the facts, which I must acknowledge with prominence.</strong></a></span> There was a real crime and a very serious one.</p>
<p>No 15 year old girl should ever have to undergo abusive contact by a predator like Weiner. Nor is she in <em>any way whatsoever</em> responsible for any actions by other adults. She is a pure victim.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>The second</strong></span> thing I want to correct in this story is my blame on ADA Dana Boente.  President Obama removed him from the line of succession. This now appears to have been a clever and successful feint into trapping Trump into reappointing Boente. He clearly has the trust of Director Comey and DUSA Rosenstein, and therefore has mine. I apologize fulsomely to him.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the story goes, it is vital to emphasize, and I do, that if men pretended that they were an abuse victim, that is on them and them alone. Such actions, showing intent, would <em>add to Weiner&#8217;s guilt and not diminish it</em>. If grown men faked any thing, as coming from an underage victim of crime, that, again, is on them, and not in any way whatsoever on the victim of the crime.</p>
<h2>The Carolina Conspiracy Remains My Theory, Although Founded on a Real Crime</h2>
<p>I also want to be clear, however, that I am not correcting, or altering, my overall theory in this article on Trump and Russia. I believe based on all the evidence that Mr. Weiner <em>also</em> sexted and emailed with grown men who were not the real girl he factually abused, but whom he <em>thought</em> were that same girl.</p>
<p>I believe, based on the evidence of the<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring"><strong> indictment by the FBI of Nikulin in Federal Court in October 2016,</strong></a> that he used Formspring to plant a virus on Anthony Weiner&#8217;s computer and sway the election. From none of that do I resile. Weiner is a predator and a true crime took place with an underage victim. That does not exclude the rest of these events happening, and the<a href="http://praguemonitor.com/2017/05/12/court-adjourns-hearing-russian-hackers-extradition"><strong> FBI charge of Nikulin supports it.</strong></a> Thus, the thrust of the theory of a conspiracy in South Carolina, by <a href="http://praguemonitor.com/2017/05/12/court-adjourns-hearing-russian-hackers-extradition">hackers allied with Donald Trump and with Russia,</a> to enable the seizure of Weiner&#8217;s computer, and to throw the election, remains. The fact is this conspiracy was enabled by a real offense of Weiner&#8217;s, it appears from his plea in court (as best I understand it). I have altered the text below to reflect the reality of that predatory offense.</p>
<h3>How Vladimir Putin Catfished A US Election With the Collusion of Team Trump</h3>
<p>Did Russia use a criminal case against Anthony Weiner &#8211; so their hacker Nikulin could plant Hillary’s emails on his computer?</p>
<p>It was the Comey letter that handed the election to Trump. Even if corrupt elements in the FBI Field Office in New York, penetrated by Russia, forced Comey&#8217;s hand &#8211;  even if Russian hacker Nikulin <em>did </em>plant emails on Anthony Weiner&#8217;s computer &#8211; there had to be a separate criminal case in the first place for the NYPD and FBI to go looking. I thought there was not &#8211; as above, I was wrong.</p>
<p>Did Vladimir Putin direct an attack  by a hardened group of adult hackers from North Carolina who penetrated the emails of Director Brennan of the CIA, and doxed and attacked hundreds of FBI and law enforcement personnel?</p>
<p class="p1">In this story I exclusively report the connections between the USSR-CWA hacker group of North Carolina ‘Crackas With Attitude’ and the sexts with, ostensibly, a 15 year old girl from Gaston, North Carolina, who had early in 2016 been a genuine victim of Weiner&#8217;s predatory behavior. That started the chain of events that led to James Comey’s forced letter to Congress, including the fact that the an email to Weiner ostensibly written by his earlier victim  is in fact a series of plagiarized texts it is unlikely any 15 year old girl has read, including works by J.D. Salinger, David Foster Wallace, Charles Bukowski, and &#8211; yes &#8211; “Fight Club” by Chuck Palahniuk.</p>
<p class="p1">There is also direct evidence that members of the Trump campaign were involved in this conspiracy and knew in advance what was coming &#8211; including Lara Trump, who visited Gaston, North Carolina, some days before she promised an ‘October surprise’ and ’tricks up our sleeve.’</p>
<h3 class="p1">Russia’s Hacker Nikulin, Formspring, and Anthony Weiner</h3>
<p class="p1">Russia, I believe, manipulated chain of events that forced James Comey’s letter to Congress. All available data shows that it was the timing of this letter that handed the election to Donald Trump. On November 3<span class="s1"><sup>rd</sup></span>, just before the election, the Russian plane MKATE and Putin’s bagman Rybolovev met Donald Trump’s campaign plane on the tarmac at Charlotte, North Carolina. By that time, events in North Carolina had swung the election to Mr. Trump.</p>
<p class="p1">In my first piece of work at Patribotics I laid out a unified theory on Russian active measures against the United States, including as part of it that Russia has a team of influencers inside the FBI Field Office in New York (the criminal division) and I regret to say, the NYPD, who work directly with Rudy Giuliani and General Flynn.</p>
<p class="p1">I drew readers’ attention to the arrest in Prague of the Russian hacker, Yvgeny Nikulin. He was indicted on charges of hacking Dropbox, Linked in and Formspring in 2012-2013.</p>
<p class="p1">Formspring is the little-known sexting app that Anthony Weiner used for his sexting the first time around.</p>
<p class="p1">My theory was that Nikulin, on instructions from the Russian state, “woke” or “planted”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a laptop of Anthony Weiner’s via a virus which he placed on it through his prior hack of Formspring, and alerted Russia’s moles and agents of influence in the FBI field office in New York, who subsequently “leaked” to all and sundry that the emails had been found, and, by Rudy Giuliani’s own testimony, pressured James Comey into sending the letter he did.</p>
<p class="p1">However, the emails were &#8211; nonetheless-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>found as part of an unrelated criminal investigation into Weiner’s sexting with a 15 year old girl. The story of these “sexts” broke Sep 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span> in the Daily Mail with a byline from Alana Goodman.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Who Was Weiner Actually Talking To?</h3>
<p class="p1">I can exclusively report that there is ample evidence that suggests that Weiner was sexting not only with a 15 year old girl,   but, <strong><a href="http://archive.is/aZziR">later and separately with hackers, </a></strong><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring">working for Russia</a>, including the North Carolina hacking group ‘Crackas With Attitude’, who hacked the head of the CIA, and a great many FBI agents, police officers, and other law enforcement officials.</p>
<p class="p1">There is evidence linking Russia’s propaganda outlet Sputnik to both acts of hacking; and there is, therefore, grave reason to be concerned about Trump’s choice of Dana Boente as Jeff Sessions’ second-in-command at the Justice Department. Which he now is. For in a little-noticed Executive Order released this weekend, Trump altered the order of succession at the Justice Department in order to make Boente second to Sessions.</p>
<p class="p1">Two of the Americans involved in Crackas With Attitude were arrested and took a guilty plea in December.</p>
<p class="p1">And one of the prosecuting AGs on that case? Dana Boente.</p>
<p class="p1">As I have previously reported, Jeff Sessions was placed by Trump as Attorney General, I believe, for the sole reason of protecting Trump from impeachment and prosecution in the matter of Russia’s hack on America. The placement of Boente as Sessions’ number two ought to raise yet another red flag. For Dana Boente is listed as AG on the North Carolina Crackas With Attitude case.</p>
<p class="p1">If I am right on the theory which I report here &#8211; that Crackas With Attitude conspired with Russian moles within the FBI and NY in New York, with the encouragement of Sputnik, to use a real criminal case against Anthony Weiner <i>in order that </i><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring">Russia’s Nikulin could plant Hillary Clinton’s emails</a> on Weiner’s now “discoverable” laptop &#8211; then Messrs Trump and Bannon, above all other things, need the CWA case to <i>go away really fast </i><span class="s2"><i>&#8211; </i>and now its prosecutor Dana Boente finds himself number two to Jeff Sessions in Trump&#8217;s Justice Department. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Thus far, the term ‘Russian hacking’ as it relates to the US elections has been understood by the mainstream media to mean two things: the hack of the DNC and Republican politicians’ emails, and the phishing attack on John Podesta, plus the subsequent release of emails obtained by those attacks through Russia’s puppet organization, Wikileaks. (To a lesser extent, the mainstream media also acknowledges that Russia backed and created a fleet of Twitter bots. They have not yet shown much sign of understanding that what is sloppily termed ‘fake news’ is in fact a coordinated Russian propaganda effort.)</p>
<p class="p1">But the Russian hack on the United States was, it seems far more direct than that.</p>
<p class="p1">It forced the Comey letter out of thin air. Using Weiner&#8217;s sleazebag tendencies, Russia used a real, underage victim of his sexts, to catfish Weiner into further communications actually written by an adult hacker, and thus used a real crime to commit a political hack on his computer. Then, with pliant moles in the NY FBI Field Office and NYPD, they seized his laptop. Nikulin planted Hillary&#8217;s emails upon it. Russian moles in the FBI Field Office leaked, tweeted and threatened &#8211; and even Lara Trump (from North Carolina) boasted in advance that the &#8216;October surprise&#8217; was coming.</p>
<p class="p1">From start to finish, Russia manipulated the Director of the FBI into sending his letter &#8211; which Jason Chaffetz leaked, by arrangement with the Trump camp, I believe, in order directly to swing the election to Donald Trump, Putin&#8217;s puppet.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Who Are Crackas With Attitude and How Do They Connect Weiner and Russia?</h3>
<p class="p1">The hacker group’s name, sources say, is a pun. The letters USA in Cyrillic look like the American letters “CWA”. Be that as it may, CWA involved an underage English hacker who was arrested, and subsequent to his arrest, two of his co-conspirators in North Carolina were also arrested. Their attack on the United States was exceptionally serious. It involved obtaining emails from the then Director of the CIA and doxing hundreds of United States law enforcement and intelligence personnel.</p>
<p class="p1">The 15 year old girl is also apparently from North Carolina, according to reports, and her father is an attorney.</p>
<p class="p1">However, I can exclusively report that there is extensive evidence online that some “sexts” were not written by that 15 year old girl, but by members of the hacking gang.</p>
<h3 class="p1">“You Got Catfished by a Dude”  &#8211; Or, The Infinite Jest of a Plagiarized Email</h3>
<p class="p1">It was no use Yvgeny Nikulin planting Hillary Clinton’s emails on Weiner’s computer, or even waking Weiner’s computer, on behalf of Russian assets in the FBI New York, unless they had a right to look at Weiner’s computer. For that to happen, Anthony Weiner had to have committed a <i>criminal offense </i>that would enable NYPD to have probable cause to go through his computers in the first place.</p>
<p class="p1">And for that, Nikulin used a crime against an underage victim to activate one of his own (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring">a previously implanted virus</a>).</p>
<p class="p1">All of Anthony Weiner’s sleazy sexting prior to this had been done with girls and women over the age of sexual consent. The youngest among them was 17 years old. In order for a case to be created, there needed to be an underage victim &#8211; and now, contrary to my earlier theory, we know there was one. It seems evident that just such an operation was planned by Russia; to use a victim in a criminal case, to allow Weiner’s computers to be seized and for Nikulin to thereafter plant his emails via Formspring.</p>
<p class="p1">According to the “breaking story” of September 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span>, by Alana Goodman in the Daily Mail, this girl had begun to sext with Weiner in January 2016. Her original story is odd and convoluted in a number of respects.</p>
<p class="p1">Firstly, the story is dated September 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span>, but publishing dates on videos contained within the story appear to indicate that they were uploaded some six days earlier.</p>
<p class="p1">Secondly, the story contains a report that Weiner “provided emails that he says proved he was the subject of a hoax” but the journalist does not tell us <i>why </i>Mr. Weiner said these emails proved this.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, there is the one sentence: “You got catfished by a dude.”</p>
<p class="p1">But, I believe the 15 year old girl&#8217;s letter, as quoted, was not written by her.</p>
<p class="p1">It is full of plagiarized quotes from novels. A second letter, ostensibly written by her to James Comey, appears to contain an odd phrase used by Julia Hahn, a former Breitbart writer whom Steve Bannon brought into the White House, and Michelle Bachman.</p>
<p class="p1">The author of that letter not only <i>claims</i> to be a “dude” ‘catfishing’, that is to say, a hacker pretending to be a woman or girl in order to entrap, but “her” email contains the following passages:</p>
<p class="p1">1. “My posture was consciously congruent to the back of my chair” &#8211; from the opening of Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace</p>
<p class="p1">2. “We’re the middle children of history….” To the words “But we won’t.” &#8211; From Fight Club, Chuck Palahniuk</p>
<p class="p1">3. “Guilt is guilt. It doesn’t go away…” to the words “paralyzing you.” &#8211; From Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters and Seymour an Introduction, both by J.D. Salinger</p>
<p class="p1">4. “I was losing my soul….” To “…you still have a soul to lose.” &#8211; From Tales of Ordinary Madness, “A Dollar and Twenty Cents” by Charles Bukowski.</p>
<p class="p1">In the letter “she” signs off “Girl that lost her faith in America”. “Lost her faith in America” turns up both in a quote from Michelle Bachmann and a <a href="http://archive.is/3tsP1">Breitbart article by Julia Hahn.</a></p>
<p class="p1">The above is the classic signature of a cat-fishing attempt. But there is plenty more online to connect this North Carolina teen with the Crackas With Attitude hack.</p>
<p class="p1">Just as Nikulin planted a virus using Weiner’s little known sexting app Formspring, in this case, Weiner had been using the little-known app Confide. <a href="http://archive.is/aZziR">Online, arch references</a> were <a href="http://archive.is/pkpR3">made</a><a href="http://archive.is/aZziR">  in advance</a> about the publication of Goodman’s article as to what was going on, using the word <a href="http://archive.is/aZziR">“Confide”</a>. Other accounts with ostensibly no knowledge of the case stated plainly that Weiner was <a href="http://archive.is/pkpR3">actually sexting with a 28 year old hacker</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the North Carolina Crackas With Attitude is Justin Liverman, who is around 28. His co-conspirator is one Andrew Otto Boggs. The two were arrested and pled guilty in January. As recently as two weeks ago, the FBI had confiscated their laptops and thumb drives.</p>
<h3 class="p1">CWA or USSR &#8211; The Hacking Group</h3>
<p class="p1">Hackers need not be Russian to work on behalf of Russia. In this case, CWA’s UK and US branches had close links to Sputnik, the Russian state owned propaganda channel. A ‘journalist’ called Cassandra Fairbanks, @CassandraRules, on Twitter, who was and probably is ‘active in the hacker community’, posted photographs of herself with Liverman and said she was raising money for his defense. And why not? Weren’t CWA just some young punks that got in over their heads?</p>
<p class="p1">The answer to that is no. The CWA hack managed to get into the emails of the director of the CIA. Executives at Sputnik pressured non-Russian staff to obtain these CIA emails and threatened them if they refused. However, it is almost certain that Sputnik already had the emails; as soon as American staff refused to release them, Wikileaks was handed them and put them out on the internet. The young boy, 15, in the UK, who had been tricked into doing a hack by and for adults, was conveniently too young to punish properly. But his fully adult co-conspirators were not. CWA’s North Carolina contingent used the same hack to dox FBI and law enforcement, mercilessly harassing American intelligence and police personnel, writing phone scripts that would ring officers on the hour through the hour through the night. Sputnik adopted Bernie Sanders and pro-Palestine colors when it wanted to defend the hackers.</p>
<p class="p1">Meanwhile, Ms. Fairbanks was promoting every anti-American hacker, defined by the IC as Russian state hackers, known to mankind. She “loved” Guccifer 2. She fangirled over Wikileaks and the Russian asset Julian Assange. Fairbanks also pushed out co-ordinated Russian propaganda from Infowars and others during the election, including pizzagate and other Russian-organized propaganda spread by Mike Flynn and other Russian agents of influence. But with CWA she held personal meetings, photographing herself with Liverman and helping fund his defense in court.</p>
<p class="p1">The Daily Mail, Sputnik, and Trump</p>
<p class="p1">There seems to be a strong friendship between the Daily Mail’s journalist Alana Goodman, who wrote the 15 year old girl story on which the criminal case was based, and Ms. Fairbanks of Sputnik. They photographed themselves on multiple occasions together in social settings, such as sabering bottles of champagne at Trump Tower. They defended each other on Twitter. Ms. Goodman appears in many tweeted photographs by Miss Fairbanks. At one debate, Miss Goodman stars in a photograph of herself wearing a ‘Make America Great’ cap pulled down over her head. Sputnik’s Miss Fairbanks points everybody to Goodman’s story on Weiner of the 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span>. Goodman is also apparently close to the Trump campaign’s Moishe Lee.</p>
<p class="p1">Sputnik’s Cassandra Fairbanks was also invited to the Inaugural Freedom Ball, which is quite an honor for a mouthpiece of the Russian state, and tweeted her pictures close to Trump and the First Lady. She followed this ostensibly unlikely triumph by spending New Year’s eve, too, with Miss Goodman (shortly after her photograph with Justin Liverman of CWA).</p>
<p class="p1">Yet while Ms. Fairbanks promoted Ms. Goodman’s exclusive on the 15 year old girl, on Twitter, her own organ, Sputnik, and <a href="http://rt.com">RT.com</a>, seemed awfully reticent to promote it<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&#8211; or even to touch it. Although both Russian channels covered the <i>preceding</i> Weiner scandal, involving the married Weiner, his young son in a photograph, and an adult woman, there was <i>no mention whatsoever </i>online on both Russian media channels of this story. Even though, ostensibly, it was the far more important one. Previously, all Anthony Weiner’s sexting had been done with overage women or girls over the age of consent. It was sleazy, and pathetic, certainly, and his wife, Huma Abedin, separated from him. But it was not criminal.</p>
<p class="p1">Russia and its spies within the FBI needed it to be criminal.</p>
<p class="p1">And yet RT and Sputnik showed an admirable, one might say inexplicable, level of restraint when confronted with the story of what appeared to be an <i>actual </i>crime by Weiner.</p>
<p class="p1">There are other disturbing notes to be made about the manner of the publication of the story. While it was reported as ‘breaking news’ on September 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span> by Miss Goodman, online dates on the videos embedded within the story appear to show they were shot six days earlier. Why was the story held, if indeed it was? On September 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span>, Eric Lichtblau, who would later publish a substantially false story at the New York Times saying that the FBI investigating Trump’s server ‘found no clear links to Trump’, alerted Alfa Bank with a question about their involvement with the server. At that point, Trump’s server went dark. It was certainly a most opportune time to publish a major distraction that could have major consequences.</p>
<p class="p1">Sputnik’s Miss Fairbanks also seemed to know that publication was imminent; she decided to pose in an arch t-shirt for Wikileaks that said ‘Publish or Perish’ which she said she was ‘wearing for traveling’.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Foreknowledge from the FBI NY, the NYPD, Lara Trump, Giuliani and Flynn</h3>
<p class="p1">It is by now well-known that now disgraced General Mike Flynn, and Rudy Giuliani, once a Secretary of State contender, boasted in advance of the ‘October surprise’ that was coming based on “emails discovered” on Weiner’s laptop as part of the “separate criminal case”. The FBI Field Office in New York, indeed, have hung themselves up nicely by leaking on Russia’s behalf to these people but also by tweeting from an account. Giuliani’s partner boasted that the NYPD was also corrupt; that if Director Comey did not write to Congress, the letter that handed the election to Trump, they, the NYPD, would call a press conference announcing all the ‘arrests’ they had made in the “Weiner sexting” case.</p>
<p class="p1">But, partly perhaps from sexism, partly from fear of attacking the first family, not enough attention has been paid to the Trump family’s <i>own </i>Carolina connection, and part in the conspiracy. Lara Yunaska, NC, now Lara Trump, NY, boasted on the radio, in advance, that an October surprise was coming &#8211; something she had no legal way of knowing. The FBI and NYPD are not supposed to leak information on criminal cases, particularly those ostensibly involving sexual abuse of a minor, to politicians for political purposes. Yet Mrs. Eric Trump was on the radio, bold as brass, saying on October 24 that ‘there are still a few days in October’ and ‘we’ve got a couple of things up our sleeve.’</p>
<p class="p1">On 29<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> October, when the Comey letter had been leaked by Jason Chaffetz, North Carolina native Lara Trump went further, saying on the radio to ABC’s Rita Cosby that <i>Trump </i>had “forced” Comey’s hand with the letter.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“</span><span class="s4"><i>I think my father-in-law forced their hand in this. You know, he has been the one since the beginning saying that she shouldn’t be able to run for president, and I commend him on that”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1">Lara Trump said.</p>
<p class="p1">These interviews followed her trip, with her husband Eric, to Gastonia, Gaston County, North Carolina. <a href="http://www.gastongazette.com/news/20161019/eric-and-lara-trump-to-campaign-for-donald-in-gastonia">According to the Gaston County Gazette</a>, Lara and Eric Trump visited the GOP headquarters there on October 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span>.</p>
<p class="p1">I tried to discover the identity of the real teenage girl and her father for this story (since both Ms. Goodman and Buzzfeed News claimed to have spoken to them). But I could not do so. I am glad now that I could not find out their identities.</p>

<h2>Update: Fri 12 May:</h2>
<p>There are rumors within the intelligence community that indictments are either being prepared, or presently exist, sealed, against the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. One source reports that Sessions may be arrested, or a case against him announced, later today, Friday March 12th. Although I cannot find another source at this late hour to agree, the RUMINT is interesting enough that I am passing it on to readers as an update to the below post, originally published on the day Sessions was confirmed as Attorney General.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; Original Article&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Jeff Sessions has just been confirmed. It is now incumbent on patriotic Republicans and Democrats, and, failing that, patriotic lawyers willing to bring cases, to demand that Sessions recuse himself from any and all investigations concerning Russian hacking of the election, the Department of Justice investigation into corruption and election interference by the FBI field office in New York and the NYPD, and any investigations involving Steve Bannon or Trump or Breitbart campaign staff, past or present.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Part One: Sessions &#8211; Suspect or Material Witness in Any Russian Hacking Inquiry</span></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Jeff Sessions Recruited Carter Page, Under FBI Investigation</strong></h2>
<p>Even those who are only loosely following the Russian hacking story must be aware of the names of Carter Page and Paul Manafort, and of the FISA warrant, which Ii reported was issued to the FBI’s counter-intelligence division in Connecticut on October 15, 2016, concerning the activity of the server in Trump Tower and of two Russian-linked banks, Alfa Bank and SVB (Silicon Valley Bank).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Jeff Sessions was first announced by the Trump campaign as its ‘National Security Adviser’. He was next announced by the Trump campaign as its ‘Foreign Policy Adviser.’ Senator Sessions has no experience in either of these areas of policy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On March 16</span><span style="font-weight:400;">th</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, then Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told Newsmax that Jeff Sessions, personally, was putting together Trump’s foreign policy team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On March 21</span><span style="font-weight:400;">st</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, the Washington Post reported its interview with Trump in which he states that this list of foreign policy advisers includes Carter Page. The transcript is not perfectly accurate. If one listens to the audio recording at the top of the article, however, Trump says: ‘Give me the list, Corey [Lewandowski], so I can be a little more accurate here.’ He then reads the names from a piece of paper, explaining the odd cadence (as written) of ‘Carter Page, PhD,’ which is not how one normally announces the name of a team member, but does reflect how Page might be described on a written list.</span></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1396" data-permalink="https://patribotics.blog/2017/02/07/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-suspect/dan4-2/" data-orig-file="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg?w=845" data-orig-size="585,448" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Dan4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg?w=845?w=300" data-large-file="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg?w=845?w=585" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1396" src="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg?w=845" alt="Dan4.jpeg" srcset="https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg 585w, https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://patribotics.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/dan41.jpeg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px"   /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This detail suggests that Trump himself knew little of Page. Miller is on the record as saying that Jeff Sessions is putting the team together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Carter Page had absolutely no, zero, foreign policy experience. This odd choice was remarked upon at the time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Senator Sessions must explain why he chose Carter Page, who went to Russia in July and reportedly met with <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/the-mystery-of-trumps-man-in-moscow-214283">Sechin on sanctions and the head of Russian intelligence, Igor Diveykin, charged with hacking America&#8217;s election</a>.</span></p>
<p>Politico reported that <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/the-mystery-of-trumps-man-in-moscow-214283">Carter Page also met Sergei Ivanov, &#8220;until recently Putin&#8217;s Chief of Staff&#8221;.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/26/Editorial-Opinion/Graphics/2016.09.25_FBI_letter.pdf?tid=a_inl">Senator Sessions must answer if he had any input into</a>, or oversight of,<a href="https://twitter.com/gopisascam/status/826997997103755266"> Carter Page’s letter to Director Comey of (September)</a>, in which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/26/Editorial-Opinion/Graphics/2016.09.25_FBI_letter.pdf?tid=a_inl">Page carefully says</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Yet for the record, I have not met this year with any sanctioned official in Russia despite the fact that there are no restrictions on U.S. persons speaking with such individuals</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This language is so carefully parsed, that Carter Page could have met</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Sanctioned Russians working for the Russian government, who are not officials, in Russia, in 2016 &#8211; that would include Sergei Ivanov</li>
<li>Sanctioned Russian officials, in 2016, outside of Russia</li>
<li>Any Russian person on the sanctions list, including officials, in Russia up to the end of December 2015, for example at the RT.com dinner at which Mike Flynn was present</li>
<li>Any Russians whatever including Putin himself outside of Russia in 2016.</li>
</ol>
<p>Carter Page (in regards to the Alfa Bank server) has or had &#8216;an office around the corner from Trump Tower&#8217;. And these are only the top lines of his suspicious contact and total lack of qualifications, to have been chosen by Sessions.</p>
<p>Jeff Sessions must answer for his recruitment of one of the FBI&#8217;s top suspects in Russia&#8217;s hack on America, believed also to have offered to lift sanctions in exchange for assistance to Trump in the election; and who features in the Steele dossier.</p>
<h2>Jeff Sessions Is Connected to Alfa Bank, Named in Comey&#8217;s FISA Warrant</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Jeff Sessions is deeply connected to Alfa Bank, one of the banks named in the FISA Court’s October warrant. His chief of staff Richard Burt is a lobbyist for Alfa Bank. According to the Steele dossier, Trump was required to switch positions on Ukraine in exchange for intelligence. This happened in April, according to the dossier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">April is when Paul Manafort joined the campaign as its manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">April 17 is when Richard Burt, Alfa Bank lobbyist and Jeff Sessions chief of staff, wrote a Trump speech that did just what the Steele dossier requested Trump do. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/Trump-Campaign-Denies-Ties-Russia/2016/10/07/id/752155/"><span style="font-weight:400;">http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/Trump-Campaign-Denies-Ties-Russia/2016/10/07/id/752155/</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nor did it stop there. <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/Trump-Campaign-Denies-Ties-Russia/2016/10/07/id/752155/">Alfa Bank’s Mr. Burt</a>, whom, like Carter Page, <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/Trump-Campaign-Denies-Ties-Russia/2016/10/07/id/752155/">the Trump camp tried to wash its hands of, denying contact</a>, continued to advise Jeff Sessions during the summer and wrote policy papers for him. Newsmax <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/Trump-Campaign-Denies-Ties-Russia/2016/10/07/id/752155/">reports</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight:400;">“while the <strong>Trump campaign denies Burt&#8217;s involvement</strong>, the lobbyist &#8230; was <strong>invited to attend dinners hosted by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions</strong>, Trump&#8217;s <strong>national security committee chairman, to discuss national security and foreign policy. Burt and another source told Politico that he also wrote white papers for Sessions on those subjects</strong>.” Burt said “he delivered his advice through an intermediary, whom he would not name”. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But Mr. Burt was in the direct pay of Alfa Bank. Sessions must name that intermediary.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Sessions is directly responsible then for three of the most crucial things in any criminal, intelligence or Congressional investigation Russian hacking of the election: the recruitment of Carter Page, Trump’s shift in foreign policy towards Ukraine and Russia, directly matching the time and the substance as reported in the Steele dossier to be ‘payment’ for Russian hacking, and for deep connections to Alfa Bank, on which the FBI FISA warrant was finally granted. He would be both a suspect, and a key witness. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Part Two: Jeff Sessions Must Not Prevent Criminal FBI, DOJ Inquiries Into His Friends and Colleagues</span></strong></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Sessions Must Extradite Nikulin, Russian Hacker Who Attacked Anthony Wiener’s Computer</span></h2>
<p>Jeff Sessions as Attorney General would be in the position of prosecuting, or not, Yvgeny Nikulin, the Russian hacker <strong>who connects Russia’s attack on America and the sedition of the FBI Field Office in New York.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Elements within the NYPD and the FBI Field Office in New York are suspected of criminal conspiracy with Donald Trump and his electoral team, including, but not limited to, the National Security Adviser General Mike Flynn, Rudy Giuliani, and <a href="https://twitter.com/JaneSays10/status/823424249742303232">Lara Trump, the wife of Eric Trump.</a>  </span></p>
<p>Before the release of Director Comey&#8217;s election-altering letter, which was wrongfully, perhaps criminally, leaked by Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the following people had boasted in advance that the FBI Field Office in New York and the NYPD were leaking to them about &#8220;criminal inquiries&#8221; into both Wiener and the Clinton Foundation, and that they had &#8220;a surprise&#8221; coming, which would alter the political course of the election:</p>
<p>General Mike Flynn, National Security Adviser</p>
<p>Rudy Giuliani, legally advising the President</p>
<p>Lara Trump</p>
<p>and others.</p>
<p>Mr. Nikulin was picked up on October 5th in Prague on an FBI Red Warrant. That is exceptionally serious. He has still not been extradited. His indictment, issued October 21, states that he &#8216;transmitted a code&#8217; to a computer and mentions that he hacked, with admin credentials, LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring.</p>
<p>Formspring is the application Anthony Wiener first used for sexting. It closed altogether in 2014</p>
<p>There is clearly every likelihood that Nikulin &#8220;woke&#8221; Anthony Wiener&#8217;s old computer and activated or planted copies of emails upon it. The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring">DoJ indictment states</a> that</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the indictment, the defendant also caused damage to computers belonging to a LinkedIn employee and <strong>to Formspring by transmitting a program, information, code, or command.</strong>  Nikulin also is alleged to have <strong>used the credentials of LinkedIn and Formspring employees in connection with the computer intrusions</strong>.  Further, Nikulin is alleged to have <strong>engaged in a conspiracy with unnamed co-conspirators to traffic stolen Formspring user credentials</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did you get that?</p>
<p>&#8220;Nikulin is alleged to have <strong>engaged in a conspiracy with unnamed co-conspirators to traffic stolen Formspring user credentials&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>That means a Russian hacker traded credentials of Anthony Wiener, to whom?</p>
<p>The indictment further states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nikulin was arrested on Oct. 5 by officials in the Czech Republic pursuant to an Interpol Red Notice based on a warrant issued in connection with a criminal complaint. He remains in custody in Prague, Czech Republic.</p></blockquote>
<p>My theory, to be explicit, is that Russian hackers, working with and for the Trump campaign, handed over Anthony Weiner&#8217;s sexting credentials; that emails were planted on his computer: that the FBI and NYPD elements in New York (Field Office) boasted to the Trump camp they had an &#8220;October Surprise&#8221; coming: and they forced Director Comey to reveal his private letter.</p>
<p>Is Jeff Sessions going to bring home to America this accused criminal, Nikulin, taken in Prague on an ultra-serious Interpol Red Notice, when Nikulin could indict all his friends and colleagues on the Trump campaign?</p>
<p>Will Congress and those Republicans who trust Sessions force him to do this?</p>
<p>Will Sessions try to dismiss the extradition of the hackers Comey has picked up abroad? Will he try to prevent deep prosecution of Nikulin? Will he tread on the extant six-agency taskforce, or refuse to recuse himself, a suspect, in Russian hacking?</p>
<p>It is saddening to me that patriot Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham are voting yes on Jeff Sessions because they know him, when Sessions, for deniability, <em>refused to read </em>the Russian hacking report.</p>
<p>They should limit his power as AG &#8211; or lawyers with conflict of interest specialities should go to the courts to remove him.</p>

<h2 class="p1">PART ONE: PAWN TAKES QUEEN</h2>
<p class="p3">I have an overarching theory of Russia’s attack on America and the West. Here it is.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>There have not been a series of attacks on America and Europe by Vladimir Putin. There has been <em>one single operation</em>; it is the <em>same operation</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="p3">By 2008, possibly even earlier, according to John Schindler, a National Security expert formerly at the NSA, <a href="http://observer.com/2016/08/the-real-russian-mole-inside-nsa/">Russia had placed moles in the highest levels of US counter-intelligence</a>. I take this as my starting-point, because all the subsequent facts bear it out.</p>
<p class="p3">Mr. Putin always wanted to use the strength of the West as a lever to attack it, because Russia is weak and poor. So he did, and he used a very old-fashioned and effective method. Spies inside the IC. He also believes in propaganda and mind-games. He uses them on the West, he uses them on Russians, in Russia.</p>
<p class="p3">Hillary Clinton correctly noted that Putin rigged his own election in 2011. This, apparently, is when he started to hate her.</p>
<p class="p3">By the 2012 election, <a href="https://twitter.com/DrJillStein/status/265628616744894464">Russia’s desire to interfere</a> with American democracy was already there, but it as yet didn’t have the tools to succeed in that aim. I deliberately omit some of the timeline here in order to get to the bigger points in the story, but I will return to it later.</p>
<p class="p3">Russian moles placed inside the NSA recruited Edward Snowden.<a href="http://heatst.com/politics/assange-doc-suggests-russia-knew-in-advance-ed-snowden-would-spy-on-nsa/"> A letter between the FSB in Cuba and SENAIN in Quito held in a file marked ‘Assange’ in London</a>, dated 4<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> April 2013, the day before Snowden sent his only email on legalities, April 5<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> 2013, and before Snowden took his uppermost level documents during the rest of the month of April, proves conclusively that Mr. Snowden is a Russian agent who acted on instructions from Moscow. After Snowden fled to Hong Kong, he escaped from there by an Ecuadorean travel document arranged by Julian Assange, and tried to get to Cuba.</p>
<p class="p3">Snowden is a low-level IT idiot. He <i>had help</i> taking what he took from the NSA. I recommend the NSA review their case files and pick up the Russian moles within their agency. Snowden used stolen credentials, but it is almost certain that he received a piece of removable media like a memory card from his Russian handlers. He took military secrets. And by “he” I mean the FSB.</p>
<p class="p3">In 2013, after the Russians received all of the Snowden files, and China some of them, most press coverage concentrated on the traps that terrorists and Russian spies were able to avoid. They missed that Russian hackers would now proceed to use the NSA’s tech offensively.</p>
<p class="p3">In 2013, the Russians briefed their army of hackers.</p>
<p class="p3">In 2012/13, a young Russian hacker called Yvegeny Nikulin, then 26, was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/yevgeniy-nikulin-indicted-hacking-linkedin-dropbox-and-formspring">using Snowden’s NSA techniques &#8211; stolen credentials &#8211; to hack LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">Formspring, which shut down late 2013, was the app that Anthony Wiener used for his sexting.</p>
<p class="p3">According to John Schindler, &#8220;a hacker&#8221;(Nikulin) was picked up in Prague, October 5<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span>, <a href="http://observer.com/2016/10/east-west-spywar-heats-up-with-arrest-of-russian-hacker-in-prague/">on suspicion of interfering with the DNC and the Democrats in America’s election.</a> He had been sought on an <a href="http://observer.com/2016/10/east-west-spywar-heats-up-with-arrest-of-russian-hacker-in-prague/">FBI red warrant</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">He is being extradited to the United States (if <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-names-foreign-policy-team-led-by-senator-sessions-2016-3">Jeff Sessions, a Russia partisan who recruited the spy Carter Page into Team Trump,</a> does not try to stop it)  over strong protests from Russia. The DoJ announcement on his indictment mentioned not only Formspring, but ‘a count of conspiracy’ and ‘sending a code to a computer’.</p>
<p class="p3">It was three years later. Nikulin was now 29.</p>
<p class="p3">On Oct 26, <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/5185914034001/#sp=show-clips">Rudy Giuliani joked on television</a> about a big surprise coming in the election that would turn things around for Trump.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/28/us/politics/fbi-letter.html?_r=0">On Oct 28, Director James Comey of the FBI announced</a> that more as yet unexamined emails had been found on an old laptop of Mr. Wiener’s.</p>
<p class="p3">Mr. Putin, it is my surmise that some of the Russian moles inside US counter-intelligence work within the FBI’s criminal division, and particularly, within the New York field office.</p>
<p class="p3">It is my surmise that your hacker, Nikulin, s<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/904516/download">ent a command buried in a virus earlier transmitted by Formspring to ‘wake up’ that old computer and either find, or place, emails from Huma Abedin on to it, </a>and that you then contacted your moles inside the NYPD/  FBI NY and told them to “suddenly find” emails that, the expectation was, could not possibly be combed through in time before the election.</p>
<p class="p3">Your agents within the FBI Field Office then did a number of additional things.</p>
<p class="p3">Firstly, they illegally spoke to any friendly press and the Trump campaign about putative ongoing criminal investigations into the Clinton Foundation and the matter of her email server.</p>
<p class="p3">They told Fox News’s Brett Baier that Hillary Clinton “Would soon be indicted” and this was reported on TV, and then retracted after the damage was done.</p>
<p class="p3">They told your agents of influence, Rudy Giuliani and X Kallstrom, that ‘a group of active FBI agents’ had demanded Comey release his letter. Both of them stated as much, Mr. Giuliani specifying ‘active’ FBI agents.</p>
<p class="p3">They used your agent General Flynn &#8211; I scorn to use ‘of influence’ in this case, Flynn knew what he was doing &#8211; to say on live television that active FBI agents were talking to him about an going ‘criminal investigation’</p>
<p class="p3">And they told the New York Times that the FBI ’Saw No Clear Ties to Russia’ in the matter of the Russian bank servers. And the New York Times printed it, even though they, the Times, knew it was false.</p>
<p class="p3">Before the election, only I reported, correctly, that the FBI’s Counter-Intelligence division in Connecticut had obtained a FISA warrant for ‘any US persons’ relating to the two banks involved in the Trump Tower server; Alfa Bank and SVB Bank.</p>
<p class="p3">So your moles in the NSA recruited Ed Snowden in 2012/2013.</p>
<p class="p3">You got to work using NSA hacking techniques. Stealing legit credentials features often. You hacked Wiener in 2013 via Formspring. You waited.</p>
<p class="p3">You used your moles in the FBI Field Office and, in 2016 at the right moment, you woke up Wiener’s laptop via the ’Snowden Virus’, found or planted old emails on it, and suddenly had the FBI Field Office “find it” and then lean, hard, on Comey to produce the letter he did.</p>
<p class="p3">Your RIS moles in the FBI then engaged in some agitprop with Giuliani, Flynn, an innocent Fox News, a not-innocent New York Times who deliberately used its prior authority to rubbish Franklin Foer and David Corn’s Alfa Bank server reporting, to make absolutely certain that “Trump-Russia” was suppressed and Clinton was defeated.</p>
<p class="p3">Your agents in the FBI Field Office in New York did, however, make one incredibly stupid mistake. <a href="https://twitter.com/DustinGiebel/status/793509666055557120">A coder named Dustin Giebel caught it and he flagged it up to me</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">The trouble with hiring young and foolish men to flood twitter and Facebook, to act as your hackers and so forth, is that they are young and foolish. Trolls gonna troll.</p>
<p class="p3">In this case, the Twitter account @FBIRecordsVault ceased being dormant for the first time in two years. It went on a little tweet storm. The last tweets were attacks on Hillary Clinton with a chaser of an attack on Eric Holder, the former AG. <a href="http://heatst.com/politics/dormant-fbi-archives-twitter-account-revived-two-days-ago-pro-trump-anti-clinton/">The first tweet, however, was a tweet praising Fred C. Trump.</a> (Donald Trump has often said that his father is his only hero). It used language about Mr. Trump senior that was not only unlike any FBI descriptors ever used before, but had been lifted from Donald Trump’s commercial, company website.</p>
<p class="p3">When I saw that, I was overwhelmed with joy. It was not the severity of the offense, it was its traceability. Somebody sat at a keyboard and typed those tweets. Identifiable people. An <a href="http://heatst.com/politics/fbi-will-launch-internal-investigation-over-phantom-fbi-records-vault-tweets/">FBI statement wrongly said</a> that these were automated responses to three FOIA requests. Not true. Some identifiable person ordered and gave that statement. <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/312266-second-foia-lawsuit-targets-details-on-election-interference">When I filed a private FOIA lawsuit with Mark S Zaid and Bradley Moss, we wrote the questions in ways that would be difficult to avoid answering.</a> Who wrote those tweets? How many agents knew of them? What records exist of FBI agents or staff visiting the Trump commercial website to lift the descriptor of Fred Trump? What <i>internal </i>investigations exist into FBI agents leaking criminal investigations to Flynn and Giuliani? Do they feature any of the same agents who composed, knew of or authorized the FBI Records Vault tweets?</p>
<p class="p3">Days after our FOIA requests landed, Mr. Giuliani abruptly withdrew from his application to be Secretary of State. A week after our lawsuit was announced over non-response, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/01/12/justice-department-inspector-general-to-investigate-pre-election-actions-by-department-and-fbi/?utm_term=.ef18c04fc7a1">the Department of Justice announced an investigation into more or less every matter named in our lawsuit</a>, including the FBI Records Vault’s beautifully traceable tweets.</p>
<p class="p3">Even little pawns, like Twitter accounts, can become Queens, if you let them reach the 8<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> square, Mr. Putin.</p>
<p class="p3">So there you have it. Part One:</p>
<p class="p3">Russia has moles inside the IC, several of whom are not yet caught.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://heatst.com/politics/assange-doc-suggests-russia-knew-in-advance-ed-snowden-would-spy-on-nsa/">The NSA moles recruit Snowden</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">Assange<a href="http://heatst.com/politics/assange-doc-suggests-russia-knew-in-advance-ed-snowden-would-spy-on-nsa/"> Ecuador and Russia give Snowden orders</a>, and removable media to scrape intel and military secrets.</p>
<p class="p3">Ecuador exfiltrates Snowden to Moscow.</p>
<p class="p3">2012-2013, Russian hackers are given all of the NSA techniques. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/904516/download">Nikulin hacks Formspring and Wiener.</a> He plants a virus in his laptop. He waits and wakes it up in October.</p>
<p class="p3">Russia’s FBI Field Office moles “suddenly find” the emails, perhaps even placed on that computer, at a crucial juncture.</p>
<p class="p3">Russia’s FBI Field Office moles pressure Comey into releasing his letter, and thereby spin the election to Trump.</p>
<p class="p3">How am doing so far, Mr. Putin? You know, for a woman. And an amateur.</p>
<h2 class="p3">PART TWO<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&#8211;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  FBI: </span>WHITE KNIGHT VS BLACK KNIGHT</h2>
<p class="p3">Or,<em> James Comey’s Counterintelligence FBI</em> vs<em> Rudy Giuliani’s NY Criminal FBI</em></p>
<p class="p3">There are three parts to this theory, like a good play, and narratively, the next section ought to be about your spy ring in the University of Cambridge, your hacking of Facebook and Twitter and your propaganda wars across Europe, but as I have learned from you one must play to the audience, and I think American readers are mostly terrified that Director Comey will throw America under the bus and cover up your coup.</p>
<p class="p3">I don’t agree. Here is my take.</p>
<p class="p3">Before the BBC and the Guardian confirmed <a href="http://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/">my HeatStreet exclusive on the FISA warrant issued in October</a>, I was a lone voice in the wilderness on its existence.(And may history record that our conservative-leaning website had that scoop). When the writer Jason Leopold of Vice asked if Trump had been under investigation in September he got a GLOMAR response: ‘We can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any such records’.</p>
<p class="p3">GLOMAR responses are named for a submarine and can only be given if a matter of national security is at stake. Mr. Leopold announced he would sue, for why should a concluded investigation be a matter of national security? I told him, with little credibility then and tons now, that the GLOMAR response made sense because there is an <i>ongoing investigation into Mr. Trump </i>and his associates on a matter of national security.</p>
<p class="p3">Democrats, including Democrats in Obama’s government who ought to know better, have asked if James Comey had ‘a double standard’ over the investigations into Clinton and Trump. Yes; he did, and he does. He <i>may </i>talk about a criminal investigation. He <i>may not </i>talk about a <i>current, ongoing </i> investigation into espionage, bribery, money laundering and so forth that affects US national security.</p>
<p class="p3">Over the summer and early autumn Democrats wrongly stated that the FBI / Comey had said they were not looking into Roger Stone and had declined to investigate Roger Stone, who announced his links to Wikileaks. This came from a Senate hearing and <a href="http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l7bxVZgspk">Mr. Comey’s testimony to Democrat Rep. Nadler.</a> Rep. Nadler asked if Stone’s boasts constituted special circumstances, Comey said “I don’t think so.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It must have been frustrating for Comey. He was GLOMAR-ing Congress right to their face and they did not understand what was going on.</p>
<p class="p3">Subsequently, the heads of NSA, CIA and FBI “Glomar”ed, in no particular order, two Congressional open Russian hack hearings, one closed briefing to the House of Representatives, and in the case of the <a href="http://https://youtu.be/d_kzJ3p2I94?t=5m54s">CIA’s Director Brennan, Chris Wallace on Fox</a> News Sunday.</p>
<p class="p3">Furthermore, although Comey is a natural Republican he appeared to have played it straight. In the summer he cleared Clinton of a criminal standard of negligence. In the fall, he had been sandbagged by Russian moles inside the FBI Field Office in New York. But I do not believe Mr. Comey surrendered wrongly to ‘pressure’. He knew the moles had effective <i>kompromat</i> &#8211; the emails your hacker Nikulin planted or woke &#8211; and that were he not to revise his testimony in the light of new evidence, his far more important natsec investigation into the traitor, Donald Trump, would be discredited. He then worked around the clock to clear Mrs. Clinton.</p>
<p class="p3">All evidence shows that James Comey is pursuing your assault on America, Mr. Putin, with the fearless I expect from a counter-intelligence patriot. In June, he named Donald Trump to a FISA court as an agent of Russian influence. In July, he did the same. Both times, the court turned him down. In April, Mr. Comey received audio of Russian money financing Trump &#8211; that’s the same time that Paul Manafort joined the campaign to run it. He formed a joint CIA/FBI /Treasury task force to look at the money.</p>
<p class="p3">Over the summer, US counter-intelligence met with Chris Steele because they had already got their own independent information that he was correct. On October 5<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span>, your hacker Nikulin was picked up on an FBI ‘Red Warrant’ in Prague which means Director Comey had put a top priority on getting him some time before. Armed with whatever Nikulin spilled &#8211; and, Mr. Putin, he fainted when they caught him &#8211; Director Comey went back again, to a new FISA judge, on October 15, and he got his warrant.</p>
<p class="p3">Every indication is that Director Comey is not only independent but plays better chess than both you or I, Mr. Putin. (Can I call you VVP? I feel like I know you). For in September, the FBI did not join the ODNI statement about Russia’s intent being to aid Trump. Why not? Because while the NSA and CIA had heard the tapes of Americans in Trump’s camp working with your officials, taking your bribes, disseminating your information, <i>Director Comey had not yet received his warrant</i>. In order not to give Trump’s defense and the defense of his camps anything to go on, the FBI was Caesar’s wife. It did not act on surveillance of US persons abroad offered by the UK, Estonia, BIS, and Lithuania until it got the warrant. Director Comey does not want any ‘fruit of the poisoned tree’ defenses (no pun intended, Mr. Putin, and may I remind you sir that it is bad form to kill one’s opponents in chess. It’s cheating).</p>
<p class="p3">The FBI ‘changed’ its stance on the final Russian hacking report because they had, by then, listened to the tapes. Legally. Under a warrant.</p>
<p class="p3">The FBI has, fortunately, always employed the principle of compartmentalization. The FBI Counter-Intelligence division in New York kept their dealings secret from the criminal field office in New York.</p>
<p class="p3">But, some readers will say, Russian moles in the NSA &#8211; OK, it’s a worthy target. Why would the Russians have sleeper moles in a mere FBI criminal field office, even if it is New York?</p>
<p class="p3">And the answer to that is simple; a corrupt FBI NY Field Office guards the interest of Russian mobsters, allows them to launder their money through Trump’s “failing” casinos and building projects, makes sure that Trump being paid double for a Florida house doesn’t get investigated, allows paedophile Jeffrey Epstein to keep a mansion in New York City,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ensures that Trump’s criminal taxes don’t get investigated, and sits hard enough on the NYPD that Trump can commit crime after crime in plain sight, socializing with the FBI’s most wanted mobsters, and never get charged with a damn thing. It ensures that Manafort and Stone can live in Trump tower, that Cohen’s trips on Russian-Registered private jets get washed. It allows the “FBI” to be next to the media, including the New York Times and Fox news, and act as un-named law enforcement sources. The FBI Field Office in New York wasn’t just infiltrated by your agents to scupper Hillary Clinton, Mr. Putin. It was there to guard the money of your billionaires and to cover the tracks of your handlers in the Russian embassy and consulates. That’s why the dead security guard at the Russian consulate never got investigated. You have a lot of people in New York, and they are very affable, pleasant folks, too. I’ve met a couple.</p>
<p class="p3">But let’s get back to the game. Your trouble is that Mr. Comey is not for sale. You have nothing on him. Let’s remember your hacker Nikulin, whom Comey was chasing since who knows when. A few days ago Comey picked up another of your hackers in Spain as he was about to board a plane to France with his wife. You yourself, through your propaganda sites, connected this to the DNC hack. You had the identical reaction that you did to Nikulin being picked up. You threw a rather beta male hissy fit. <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN154132">Stanislav Lisov</a> had coded a bank virus. But there’s rather more to it than that. Lisov fits the hacker narrative in the Steele dossier. He needed paying. <a href="http://https://twitter.com/mitgc_cm/status/822830235922104321">He has Gazprom connections</a>, and he has a <a href="http://https://twitter.com/mitgc_cm/status/822830235922104321">scary interest in satellites</a>, which you, Mr. Putin, would like to weaponize against the United States.</p>
<p class="p3">But you know, the FBI caught him, none the less. Comey caught him. They know about the US company he formed, how it transferred to Oregon from Florida, and how money was funneled through a failed ‘secretive startup’.</p>
<p class="p3">The white knight is outplaying the black knight and all his moves indicate that.</p>
<h2 class="p3">PART THREE: ENDGAME &#8211; THE ‘IAGO GAMBIT’</h2>
<p class="p3">Is it really worth chronicling the rest of the match? You, Mr. Putin, have relied on big data and on propaganda, including an army of trolls. It is plain to UK intelligence that you have <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4046846/Have-Russian-SPIES-infiltrated-Cambridge-70-years-infamous-Philby-ring-ex-MI6-chief-caught-claims-new-Kremlin-intrigue.html">a Russian spy ring at Cambridge University</a>; that you may have combed through and <a href="http://heatst.com/tech/peter-thiel-trump-and-facebook-vs-cambridge-analyticas-steve-bannon/">stolen, illegally in the EU, the Facebook data of hundreds of millions of Americans</a>; that you use propagandists SCR and combined GSR and SCR to form <a href="http://heatst.com/tech/peter-thiel-trump-and-facebook-vs-cambridge-analyticas-steve-bannon/">Cambridge Analytica</a>; and that you used Twitter’s database to create a bot army.</p>
<p class="p3">It’s plain from both money and propaganda that Steve Bannon is your tool, your agent of influence; that you work through Nigel Farage and so on; that RT and Sputnik are not merely spy centers, but money-laundering tools; and that you have used ‘Big data’ of Cambridge Analytica (personality types plus propaganda from SCR) to poison the minds of Americans and indeed voters across the West. You have your hackers sitting on 4 Chan, where <a href="http://heatst.com/world/exclusive-brexit-2nd-referendum-petition-was-hacked-with-russian-emails/">the &#8216;prank&#8217; on the Brexit petition involved Russian server addresses</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">But you are a careless player, Mr. Putin. Scrubbing <a href="http://archive.is">archive.is</a> of tweets wherein @GenFlynn pushes your hideous propaganda is pretty dumb. Scrubbing Michael Cohen’s phone data is also dumb, when we have him and his daughter waltzing around Europe and the Caribbean in Russian-owned private jets. You live by the troll, sir, then you die by the troll. Your propaganda and how you pay for it is all traceable. America has its hackers, too.</p>
<p class="p3">The DoJ inquiry has fired the first shots. It’s named Erik Prince. It knows you have the Mercers, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/11/04/erik-prince-nypd-ready-make-arrests-weiner-case/">it knows about Bannon, it knows about your moles in the NYPD. </a>You see sir it all goes back to Nikulin. The NYPD ‘found’ that laptop on October 3<span class="s1"><sup>rd</sup></span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And on October 5<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span>, Nikulin comes to Prague for payment.</p>
<p class="p3">But Mr. Putin, James Comey’s friends were waiting there to turn your black pawn into our white queen. And whenever Flynn tweeted Russian agitprop, the FBI and the NSA had a URL.</p>
<p class="p3">You sir, are like a chess player in possession of all his many, many pieces, but boxed in, in the back row, and despite having them all arrayed on the board &#8211; <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-names-foreign-policy-team-led-by-senator-sessions-2016-3">Jeff Sessions as Attorney General even though </a><i><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-names-foreign-policy-team-led-by-senator-sessions-2016-3">he recruited the spy Carter Page into your team</a> &#8211; </i>despite all of that, none of it will matter. White has you trapped. You and your ally Iran. Checkmate came from the Persian phrase, “Shah Mat”.</p>
<p class="p3">The King is dead. And I didn’t even have to bother with Sessions, Page, Manafort, Stone, Flynn, and all the SIGINT that we have on them, the deals they made with Wikileaks to receive intel that you hacked and phished and planted with your viruses.</p>
<p class="p3">Impeachment of Mr. Trump is on the way.</p>
<p class="p3">What you should ask yourself is if it is in Russia’s and your own best interest for you to keep deceiving an angry America? For when the trials do start, the back-covering, the rage, the scrambling, the desperate need to seem harder on your oligarch friends than the next politician &#8211; this could harm not only you and your allies but the next generation of Russian kleptocrats too.</p>
<p class="p3">It would surely be better to give it up now, release some of that kompromat now, push Trump out, and face the anger of a relieved United States after Trump resigns.</p>
<p class="p3">But perhaps you cannot.</p>
<p class="p3">Perhaps Mr. Putin, you have played yourself right into a corner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, those who know what <i>komprat </i>you hold on them <i>also know that you hold it</i>. And they can collaborate with the FBI.</p>
<p class="p3">Chess is a good game, sir.</p>
<p class="p3">But the reason Russians are so poor is that you can’t stop playing it.</p>
